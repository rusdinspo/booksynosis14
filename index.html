But none of the sensations were as sharp and perfect as<br>they had been a few moments ago, and her moan&#x2014;a moan that<br>had begun in anticipation of ecstasy but which had already<br>devolved into nothing more than an expression of pain and<br>frustration&#x2014;drove the last vestiges of the dream from her consciousness.<br><br>The arms that a moment ago had held her in comfort were<br>suddenly a constricting tangle of sheets, and the heat of his<br>breath on her cheek faded into nothing more than the weak<br>warmth of a few rays of sunlight that had managed to penetrate<br>the blinds covering the bedroom window.<br><br>Only the fingers touching her back were real, but they were<br>not those of her husband leading her into a morning of slow<br>lovemaking, but of her eleven-year-old son prodding her to get<br>out of bed.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost nine,&#x201d; Ryan complained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna be late for<br>practice!&#x201d;<br><br>Caroline rolled over, the image of her husband rising in her<br>memory as she gazed at her son.<br><br>So alike.<br><br>The same soft brown eyes, the same unruly shock of brown<br>hair, the same perfectly chiseled features, though Ryan&#x2019;s had<br>not quite emerged from the softness of boyhood into the perfectly<br>defined angles and planes that had always made every-one&#x2014;<br>men and women alike&#x2014;look twice whenever Brad<br>entered a room.<br><br>Had the person who killed him looked twice? Had he looked<br>even once? Had he even cared? Probably not&#x2014;all he&#x2019;d want-ed<br>was Brad&#x2019;s wallet and watch, and he&#x2019;d gone about it in the<br>most efficient method possible, coming up behind Brad, slipping<br>an arm around his neck, and then using his other hand to<br>shove Brad&#x2019;s head hard to the left, ripping vertebrae apart and<br>crushing his spinal cord.<br><br>Maybe she shouldn&#x2019;t have gone to the morgue that day,<br>shouldn&#x2019;t have looked at Brad&#x2019;s body lying on the cold metal<br>of the drawer, shouldn&#x2019;t have let herself see death in his face.<br><br>Caroline shuddered at the memory, struggling to banish it.<br>But she could never rid herself of that last image she had of her<br>husband, an image that would remain seared in her memory<br>until the day she died.<br><br>There were plenty of other people who could have identified<br>him at the morgue. Any one of the partners in his law firm<br>could have done it, or any of their friends. But she had insisted<br>on going herself, certain that it was a mistake, that it hadn&#x2019;t<br>been Brad at all who&#x2019;d been mugged in the park.<br><br>A terrible cold seized her as the memory of that evening last<br>fall came over her. When Brad had gone out for his run around<br>part of the lake and through the Ramble she&#x2019;d worried that it<br>was too dark. But he&#x2019;d insisted that a good run might help him<br>get over the jumpiness that had come over him in the last couple<br>of weeks. She&#x2019;d been helping Laurie with her math homework<br>and barely responded to Brad&#x2019;s quick kiss before he&#x2019;d<br>headed out.<br><br>Hardly even nodded an acknowledgment of what turned out<br>to be his last words: &#x201c;Love you.&#x201d;<br><br>Love you.<br><br>The words kept echoing through her mind six hours later<br>when she&#x2019;d gazed numbly down at the face that was so utterly<br><br>expressionless as to be almost unrecognizable. Love you . . . love<br>you . . . love you . . . &#x201c;I love you, too,&#x201d; she whispered, her vision<br>mercifully blurred by the tears in her eyes. But in the months<br>that had passed since that night more than half a year ago, her<br>tears had all but dried up. Sometimes they still came, sneaking<br>up on her late at night when she was alone in bed, trying to fall<br>asleep, trying to escape into the dream in which Brad was still<br>alive, and neither the tears nor the anger were a part of her life.<br><br>Caroline wasn&#x2019;t quite sure when the anger had begun to<br>creep up on her.<br><br>Not at the funeral, where she&#x2019;d sat with her arms holding her<br>children close. Maybe at the burial, where she&#x2019;d stood clutching<br>their hands in the fading afternoon light as if they, too,<br>might disappear into the grave that had swallowed up her husband.<br><br>That was when she&#x2019;d first realized that Brad must have<br>known he&#x2019;d be alone in total darkness by the time he finished<br>his run around the lake. And both of them knew how dangerous<br>the park was after dark. Why had he gone? Why had he<br>risked it? But she knew the answer to those questions, too.<br>Even if he&#x2019;d thought about it, he&#x2019;d have finished his run. That<br>was one of the things she loved about him, that he always finished<br>whatever he started.<br><br>Books he didn&#x2019;t like, but finished anyway.<br><br>Rocks that looked easy to climb, but turned out to be almost<br>impossible to scale. Almost, but not quite.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, why couldn&#x2019;t you have quit just once?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d whispered<br>as she peered out into the darkness of that evening four<br>days after he&#x2019;d died. &#x201c;Why couldn&#x2019;t you just once have said,<br>&#x2018;This is really stupid,&#x2019; and turned around and come home?&#x201d;<br>But he hadn&#x2019;t, and she knew that even if the thought had<br>occurred to him, he still would have finished what he set out to<br>do. That was when anger had first begun to temper her grief,<br>and though the anger brought guilt along with it, she also knew<br>that it was the anger rather than the grief that had let her keep<br>functioning during those first terrible weeks after her life had<br>been torn apart. Now, more than half a year later, the anger was<br>finally beginning to give way to something else, something she<br>couldn&#x2019;t yet quite identify. The first shock of Brad&#x2019;s death was<br>over. The turmoil of emotions&#x2014;first the numbness brought on<br>by the shock of his death, followed by the grief, then the<br>anger&#x2014;was finally starting to settle down. As each new day<br>had crept inexorably by, she had slowly begun to deal with the<br>new reality of her life. She was by herself now, with two children<br>to raise, and no matter how much she might sometimes<br>wish she could just disappear into the same grave in which<br>Brad now lay, she also knew she loved her children every bit<br>as much as she had loved their father.<br><br>No matter how she felt, their lives would go on, and so<br>would hers. So she&#x2019;d gone back to work at the antique shop,<br>and done her best to help her children begin healing from the<br>wounds the loss of their father had caused. There had been just<br>enough money in their savings account to keep them afloat for<br>a few months, but last week she had withdrawn the last of it,<br>and next week the rent was due. Her financial resources had<br>sunk even lower than those of her emotions.<br><br>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; she heard Laurie calling from the kitchen. &#x201c;Is there<br>any more maple syrup?&#x201d;<br><br>Sitting up and untangling herself from the sheets&#x2014;and the<br>turmoil of her own emotions as well&#x2014;Caroline shooed her son<br>out of the room. &#x201c;Go tell your sister to look on the second shelf<br>in the pantry. There should be one more bottle. And you&#x2019;re not<br>going to be late for baseball practice. I promise.&#x201d;<br><br>As Ryan skittered out of the room, already yelling to his sister,<br>Caroline got out of bed, opened the blinds, and looked out<br>at the day. As the smell of Laurie&#x2019;s waffles filled her nostrils<br>and the brilliant light of a spring Saturday flooded the room,<br>Caroline shook off the vestiges of the previous night&#x2019;s dream.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to be all right,&#x201d; she told herself.<br><br>She only wished she felt as certain as the words sounded.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Monster in River Oaks</h2><p>Not since Blood and Money have such secrets of passion and possession been revealed about the residents of Houston&#39;s River Oaks neighborhood, home to some of the nation&#39;s most elite, powerful, and wealthy families.

According to Steele, the liberalism that grew out of the 1960s had as its first and all-consuming goal the expiation of America guilt rather than the careful development of true equality between the races. This "culture of preference" betrayed America's best principles in order to give whites and America institutions an iconography of racial virtue they could use against the stigma of racial shame. In four densely argued essays, Steele takes on the familiar questions of affirmative action, multiculturalism, diversity, Afro-centrism, group preferences, victimization -- and what he deems to be the atavistic powers of race, ethnicity, and gender, the original causes of oppression. <em>A Dream Deferred</em> is an honest, courageous look at the perplexing dilemma of race and democracy in the United States -- and what we might do to resolve it. </p></p><p>Shelby Steele's first book, <i>The Content of Our Character</i>, sparked outrage over its indictment of liberal American policies and attitudes towards race. <i>A Dream Deferred</i> expands Steele's critique, comparing government interventions (like affirmative action) to the most damaging practices of slavery and segregation, Soviet Communism, and Nazi Germany. <p> While Steele zealously praises civil rights victories, terming the movement that effected them "the greatest nonviolent revolution in American history (one of the greatest in all history)," he concludes that a simultaneous outcome--the stigmatization of whiteness--has led to disaster. Shamed whites try to prove their innocence through redemptive acts, according to Steele, and he has always disdained the "moral self-preoccupation" of post-'60s white liberals, which "made them dangerous to blacks--ready to give them over to an 'otherness' in which nothing is expected of them." </p><p> Steele, a self-described black conservative, complains, "The great ingenuity of interventions like affirmative action has not been that they give Americans a way to identify with the struggle of blacks, but that they give them a way to identify with racial virtuousness <i>quite apart</i> from blacks." He contends that victimization is the greatest hindrance for black Americans: while white liberals see blacks as victims to assuage guilty consciences, blacks parlay their status as victims into a currency that turns out to have no long-term buying power. Steele's conclusion: the only way for blacks to stop buying into this zero-sum game is to adopt a culture of excellence and achievement untrammeled by set-asides and entitlements. <i>--Lise Funderburg</i></p>From the author of the award-winning bestseller The Content of Our Character comes an essay collection that tells the untold story behind today&#39;s polarized racial politics.

Disillusion soon followed, then turned to disgust and fear when Shen discovered that his compatriots had tortured and murdered a doctor whose house he&#x2019;d helped raid and whose beautiful daughter he secretly adored. A story of coming of age in the midst of monumental historical upheaval, Shen&#x2019;s <i>Gang of One</i> is more than a memoir of one young man&#x2019;s harrowing experience during a time of terror. It is also, in spite of circumstances of remarkable grimness and injustice, an unlikely picaresque tale of adventure full of courage, cunning, wit, tenacity, resourcefulness, and sheer luck&#x2014;the story of how Shen managed to scheme his way through a hugely oppressive system and emerge triumphant. <p><i>Gang of One</i> recounts how Shen escaped, again and again, from his appointed fate, as when he somehow found himself a doctor at sixteen and even, miraculously, saved a few lives. In such volatile times, however, good luck could quickly turn to misfortune: a transfer to the East Wind Aircraft Factory got him out of the countryside and into another terrible trap, where many people were driven to suicide; his secret self-education took him from the factory to college, where friendship with an American teacher earned him the wrath of the secret police. Following a path strewn with perils and pitfalls, twists and surprises worthy of Dickens, Shen&#x2019;s story is ultimately an exuberant human comedy unlike any other.</p></p><p>Hailing from the People&#x2019;s Republic of China, Fan Shen is a professor at Rochester Community and Technical College in Minnesota. He has published three translated books and numerous articles in both Chinese and English."Anyone wishing to be the architect of his or her own fortune would do well to study this amazing memoir, a testament to the human spirit."&#x2014;<i>ForeWord</i> (<i>ForeWord</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[A] compulsively readable memoir. . . .

[Shen] offers a snapshot of the political wiles needed to rebel against the fate one was assigned by the party: in order to both leave the abominable and oppressive conditions and to avoid persecution, Shen learned to feign political ardor, fabricate spy stories to confound the watchful authorities, pull strings with highly placed friends and falsify health tests. Though he might seem to overly relish these clever maneuvers, Shen's portrait of the social and political climate in China is unambiguous: power rested in the hands of a few and professed loyalty to party ideologies made it unsafe to trust anyone; the only way to win was to use the party's rules to one's own ends."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"[A] book of stunning power. . . .

The authors, husband and wife, begin by talking painfully about how their own marriage nearly ended because Harville, despite obvious evidence to the contrary, didn't feel loved by his wife. As the authors note, there are many ways "to defend yourself against someone else's desire to encourage, help, or love you," whether because you overvalue your partner and feel unworthy of his or her love, or because you devalue that partner and see him or her as unworthy of giving love. The authors instruct readers to examine their childhood dynamics for unconscious influences on their view of relationships, such as uncomfortable feelings of self-rejection. And taking a page from Martin Buber, they also focus on what is "between" the I and Thou in a relationship, "the sacred space between two individuals" that can unite them or serve as a "dumping ground" for anger. These complicated concepts become clear as illustrated through in-depth looks at three heterosexual and same-sex couples.

They are the heart and soul of the United States of America, They are the Normals, the regular Americans of all races, creeds, preferences, and both sexes who just want to raise their families and live their lives in peace. And they are getting angry...<br>For decades they have seen their cherished beliefs and beloved traditions under attack. They have been told they are racist, sexist, and hateful, but it was all a lie. Their ability to provide for their families has been undermined by globalization with no consideration of the effects on Americans who did not go to Harvard, and who live in that vast forgotten space between New York and Santa Monica.<br>A smug, condescending elite spanning both established parties has gripped the throat of the nation. Convinced of their own exquisite merit while refusing to be held accountable for their myriad failures, these elitists managed to suppress the first rumblings of discontent when they arose in the form of the Tea Party. But they were stunned when the Normals did not simply scurry back to their flyover homes. Instead, the Normals came out in force and elected Donald Trump.<br>Now, as the ruling caste throws everything it can into the fight to depose Donald Trump and reestablish unchallenged control, the Normals face a choice. They can either surrender their country and their sovereignty, or they can become even more militant...<br></p><p><b>Kurt Schlichter</b> is the Senior Columnist at <i>Townhall.com</i>, where his column appears twice a week.

Insightful, provocative, and often hilarious, <i>Militant Normals </i>is a terrific explanation of our current political chaos -- and how normal Americans will prevail."&#x2015;<b><i>David Limbaugh, author and columnist</i></b><br><br>"Long before Don Lemon threw him off CNN, Kurt Schlichter attracted attention and denunciations for his '#caring' slogan in his cutting Tweets. <i>Militant Normals</i> includes the trademark pugnaciousness and acerbic wit from Kurt's Twitter feed, but it also showcases a lot more that doesn't fit in 280 characters, like substantive arguments, history and perspective that is sorely needed in our modern public discourse. You don't vent a spleen like this if you don't care deeply about something, and for all of his blistering sarcasm and sharp comebacks and deliciously condescending requests to fetch him a latte, Kurt cares about this country and its future profoundly. Kurt's fans will love it, but his foes would learn the most from this book."&#x2015;<b><i>Jim Geraghty, <i>National Review</i></i></b><br><br>"The governing classes' worst nightmare is the voters waking up to what's been done to them.

If the election of Donald Trump sent any message to the mainstream media and to the organized Left it's that the average, normal American voter is really really really pissed off. In <i>Militant Normals</i> Kurt Schlichter dives into that anger and explains where it came from. Schlichter also, most importantly, lays out how electing Trump was not the end of this discussion, it was the beginning. If you're looking for the same old tired and repetitive political analysis to help you fall asleep, put down this book and go on a political cruise instead."&#x2015;<b><i>Larry O'Connor, Radio Host</i></b><br><br>"Kurt's Schlichter's roots in Americana shine in his prose, from faith, family and patriotism to self-sufficiency, his verse on people and communities standing up for their values and their priorities veers from poetry to counter punch, making it a book that is hard to put down."&#x2015;<b><i>Salena Zito, author and reporter</i></b><br><br>"Kurt Schlichter has his finger on the pulse of normal Americans and his heel on the neck of the Washington/NewYork/LA liberal snob class. He's captured perfectly the sentiments of 'flyover land,' the people who make the country work and are sick of being worked by the coastal elites who look down their noses at them, and he's done it with biting humor. Read <i>Militant Normals</i> and learn from it because there are important lessons in there behind Kurt's snark and righteous fury."&#x2015;<b><i>Derek Hunter, author and columnist</i></b><br><br>"Kurt Schlichter's <i>Militant Normals</i> captures the ferocity and humor of his notorious Twitter feed and Townhall columns.

We're here, we're normal, get used to it. Americans of all shapes and sizes, colors and creeds are rising up in revolt over those self-styled 'elites' who want to eradicate your unhelpful opinions and your God-given rights, and Kurt Schlichter has written their manifesto.

If so, <i>Militant Normals</i> is for you. With his trademark combination of biting wit and in-your-face wisdom, Kurt Schlichter hands out plenty of ammo to the long-suffering people of America, who have risen up to defeat Hillary Clinton, elect Donald Trump, and can't wait to confront their Elitist tormentors at last.

Rescuing the proud ship Queen Ravenna from destruction, Tremaine and a resolute band of sorcerers and warriors set sail across magical seas on a voyage of danger and discovery.

She lives in College Station, Texas, with her husband.</p>The country of Ile-Rien has fallen to the Gardier, a mysterious enemy whose sorcerous weapons more than match rifles and artillery. Tremaine Valiarde, a notorious sorcerer's dilettante daughter, has begun to unlock the powers of her father's magical sphere, the only weapon that may work against the Gardier. But she is on the run and doesn't know who may be an enemy spy. Moreover, the Gardier operate in more than one world. As this book begins, Tremaine and her comrades are trying to return to their homeland the Gardier captives rescued at the end of <i>The Wizard Hunters</i> [BKL My 1 03] and form an alliance with them. Differing customs across and between worlds make this tricky, and since the Gardier occupy Tremaine's homeland, information and assistance is hard to come by. Wells has wrought characters and cultures well, but here they multiply so that one hopes that lists of both will appear in the next Ile-Rien book. Otherwise, this sequel is well done, though easier to appreciate with its predecessor under one's belt. <i>Frieda Murray</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Hoffman pioneered the use of humor, theater, and shock value to drive home his points, and in Revolution for the Hell of It he gives firsthand accounts of his legendary adventures, from the activism that led to the founding of the Youth International Party&#x2014;or "Yippies!&#x2014;to the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests ("a Perfect Mess") that resulted in his conviction as part of the Chicago Seven. Also chronicled are the mass demonstrations he led in which over fifty thousand people attempted to levitate the Pentagon using psychic energy, and the time he threw fistfuls of dollar bills onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and watched the traders scramble. With antiwar sentiment once again in a furor and an incendiary political climate not seen since the book's original printing, Abbie Hoffman's voice is more essential than ever.</p><p>&#34;No one in America better represents the spirit of the &#39;60s.&#34;</p><h2>Dumb but Lucky!: Confessions of a P-51 Fighter Pilot in World War II</h2><p>Second lieutenant Dick Curtis arrived in Italy in May 1944&#x2013;twenty years old and part of a shipment of P-51 Mustang fighter pilots so desperately needed that they were rushed into combat with less than thirty hours of flight time in their new high-performance aircraft.<br><br>Six of the twelve pilots assigned to the 52nd Fighter Group were shot down in the first two weeks. By his ninth mission, Curtis was the only one still flying. A maverick, he barely escaped court-martial with his high-flying antics. Escorting bombers sent to pound heavily defended oil fields was risky enough, but strafing the enemy supply lines, ports, and airfields was even more dangerous. Curtis may chalk up his success to dumb luck, but these missions took exceptional skill and courage. This hair-raising account captures the air war in all its split-second terror and adrenaline-pumping action.</p><p><b>Richard K. Curtis</b> earned the Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters as well as the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II. After the war, he received a B.A. in theology from Northern Baptist Seminary in Chicago and an M.S. and Ph.D. in speech communication from Purdue University.

He retired from the faculty of Purdue University in 1993.BY THE NUMBERS<br>"This man is not pilot material!"<br>--Joe Webb, Flight Instructor, 52nd College Training Detachment<br>It was the last week in October 1942 when I heard on the radio that the president was to end enlistments and rely on the draft, where the military could dictate the branch I'd serve. So I decided, as my older brother Bob had done, to take a shot at becoming a pilot in the Marines. I got Dad's permission to enlist, but not in the Marines. It stuck in his craw that the Navy had rejected Bob for something Dad scornfully dismissed as a "heart murmur." It would be the Army Air Corps. After all, it was the Army Dad had served in during World War I. And even though he'd been grievously wounded in a mustard gas attack, affecting his lungs so he couldn't speak for three and a half months, he remained a true-blue patriot and still committed to the Army.<br><br>Like Dad, I was putting in sixty-hour workweeks at Norton's, the big grinding wheel company in Worcester, Massachusetts. It proudly floated the triangular blue flag emblazoned with a big E for excellence in the war effort. But now, with others in my high school class already enlisting since June, it was time to call a halt to civilian life. So the next day I picked up application forms at the Army Air Corps recruiting office and was filling them out even as I listened to the latest news of Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, missing in the South Pacific. The following Monday I submitted the application, together with two recommendations, and was told, after a check of the papers, to report with them the next morning at 0800 hours at Fort Devens.<br><br>It was only thirty-five miles to Ayer, but it took eighty minutes for the train to get there, long enough to introduce myself to five others from Worcester headed there. The six of us chipped in fifteen cents apiece for a taxi ride to the fort where, after producing our credentials at the gate, we were issued passes. I soon realized that it was a lot easier to get that pass than to pass the several exams that made up the Air Corps mental test. There were 150 questions on such subjects as English, geometry, algebra, physics, and current events. Of the seventeen of us in the room, only eight passed, getting at least 76 right. When I learned that I got 112 right, or 19 more than the next highest grade, I had good reason to thank the teachers I had at North High for thorough preparation despite, at best, my lackluster performance.<br><br>I may have been top man on the totem pole in the exam, but in the eyes of Charlie Rich, my boss and my ride to Norton's since I got a job there after graduation, I was still a dumb cluck. So dumb, in fact, that he offered ten dollars to my five that I'd never be chosen for pilot training. So confident was I that he was wrong that I refused the bet, even at two-to-one odds.<br><br>On Monday the 9th of November I was back at Devens for a thorough physical, riding the train with Al Barrios and George Arnberg, both in their twenties and Al with a year or more of college under his belt. The only reason the Air Corps was accepting the likes of George and me was that they'd run out of men with at least a couple years of college. The physical turned out to be just as comprehensive as the mental. Nine months earlier my brother Bob had taken his, where the Army also detected something wrong with his heart. Determined to fly, and with two years at Clark University sitting under such professors as Robert Goddard, the rocket pioneer, and with a private pilot's license as well as membership in the Civil Air Patrol, Bob was not about to take no for an answer. So he'd returned no less than six times to convince them he was fit enough to fly. At last he wore them down, and now he was training as a navigator.<br><br>When I returned to Devens for the results of my physical, I learned that two others had washed out for color blindness, critical for depth perception. That left five of us of the original seventeen, and two of these were in doubt. As I took the train back to Worcester I couldn't help but reflect on my good luck. For ten years earlier, as a result of an eye exam in grade school, Dad had taken me to Dr. Fairbanks, an optometrist. There he found my left eye so bad that he fitted me with glasses in which the right lens was fogged. Finally, after two to three years, my left eye had caught up with my right eye, and I could forgo the strange spectacles that had made me the butt of ribbing at school. Little enough price to pay, now that my eyes were 20/20.<br><br>It was almost a year since Pearl Harbor, and the war news was hot and heavy. What really caught my attention were the accounts of the fliers. Vividly I recalled the words of Winston Churchill on August 20, 1940, as he stood before the House of Commons but spoke to the world in praise of the RAF fighters who'd turned back Hermann Goering's Luftwaffe, which had been doing its dead level best to pound the British Isles into submission for an invasion. "Never," the prime minister proclaimed, "in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."1 That was the same time that our own Army Air Corps assembled all of its forty fighter planes as part of the largest war games since World War I. Of the forty, only three were airworthy enough to complete their mission. In scarcely more than eighteen months we were at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy, each with hundreds of fighter planes able to complete their missions.2 Now, less than a year after Japanese dive bombers had laid waste to much of our Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, I was learning from the radio that the Japs, as we nicknamed them, disgusted that they'd not been able to down a single B-17 Flying Fortress, had resorted to bombing them from above with their dive bombers--to no avail. Then came the news that in an air battle over Guadalcanal our fighters had destroyed twelve enemy bombers and five fighters, with the loss of but seven of our own. So it appeared that our pilots were giving a good account of themselves. The question was, if I became a fighter pilot, could I give as good an account of myself?<br><br>It was Friday the 13th of November, and far from running into bad luck, I learned that I'd enlisted none too soon. For teenage boys, it was announced, could now expect to be drafted, and some before Christmas. More good news, with search planes discovering one of Rickenbacker's crew floating on a raft in the South Pacific. The next day Eddie and two more of his crew were rescued, after an incredible forty days adrift on another raft in shark-infested waters. Now the question was, could I ever be so lucky?<br><br>The following day, the 14th of November, I was sworn into the Army Air Corps Reserve, awaiting orders to be called up. At the same time it was announced that there would be three registration periods in December when all males who'd turned eighteen after January 1 would sign up. That would have included me, so my luck was holding. On November 20 came the prediction that by the end of the year the United States would have a million men overseas. A letter from Bob in Fort Monroe, Louisiana, indicated that he'd be one of them by the spring of 1943. In between swatting "these damn flies!" he penned that he was "darn glad" I'd been accepted into the Air Corps. After all, he reasoned, it was here that I had "the most opportunity because it [was] the fastest expanding branch of the entire fighting service." It was obvious that, though he'd been disappointed in not being able to follow our cousin, Dick Newton, in becoming a Marine pilot, he was happy to be training as a navigator. Learning that I'd gotten 112 on my mental test, he confided he'd gotten 130, but was kind enough to write, "I think it has been made a little harder since I took it." On the contrary. If anything, by lowering their standards, it would appear they'd made it easier. Not only had he had his nose to the grindstone at North High, but he had gotten a good dose of math and science at Clark.<br><br>Bob then proceeded to give me some good advice. As for Devens, "Don't believe more than half the baloney they dish out to you, for they don't know a thing about what will happen to you." As for my pay, "Save all the money you can in War Bonds, or you'll have to chop out a big chunk for the income tax." And when it came to my return to Worcester, "Don't plan on getting home again until the war is over." As for his plans, "When I graduate I'll be headed to Egypt, Australia, or England within a week. But," he cautioned, "don't tell Margie Winslow, my fiancee, the bad news. Keep it a secret."<br><br>Then Bob got down to my choice of a place as a flier on a plane--thinking, of course, of a bomber, where he'd be serving. Would I opt for pilot, navigator, or bombardier? In any case I'd be a commissioned officer. Of the three, Bob counseled the first two, and of these, he confided, "I chose navigator, even though most guys pick pilot." Why navigator? "Because pilot training is the longest course, and the most dangerous," as well as "very monotonous." Furthermore, "It takes lots of practice and not as much brains as a navigator." And, he added, "It takes a certain amount of luck." The question that now hung before me was, if I was deficient in the brains category, could luck make up for it? Before closing his eight-pager, Bob made a point of adding, "Pilot training is chosen by most guys because there's sort of a 'romantic appeal'--a glory--to the pilot's job. But don't let it fool you--size it up according to your opportunities and abilities--and which ever one you think you'll do best in." Then he closed with "That's my advice--if you want it." I certainly did, even though I heeded only some of it.<br><br>By this time Uncle Sam was leaning on civilians to do their share of the war effort. Not only were there sixty-hour weeks in defense plants, but restrictions were multiplying. On November 30, Worcester, like other cities along the East Coast, was placed under a strict dimout. No lights were to be seen in stores or houses, streetlights were dimmed, and the upper half of headlights were blackened. Across the nation the speed limit was 35 mph, or 30 at night, unless otherwise posted, as it was in Worcester at 25. But at that, it was faster by far than the 8 mph restriction at intersections, as Dad had pointed out. Of course, that was written in the days of the horse and buggy, yet it was still on the books.<br><br>Now, even with gasoline rationing, the oil shortage in New England was critical, prompting the Office of Price Administration chief to announce that if it came to a choice, he'd rather have New Englanders catch pneumonia than our servicemen do without oil. By November 25, the selling of heavy cream was forbidden. Then I learned that the War Production Board had closed a local plumbing supply store for a year for operating a black market.<br><br>The next day was Thanksgiving, and I had plenty to be thankful for. To celebrate it after a sumptuous meal I invited Dana, my kid brother by sixteen months, to join me at the movies, along with old-time pal Malcolm "Specs" Midgley. It was in his house I'd filled out my enlistment papers, and it was his father, the city clerk, who'd provided one of my two recommendations. So it was only right that Specs should join us, as long as he didn't mind risking a ride in the '33 Ford Bob had bought for $50 and had willed me when he enlisted. Downtown we found a long line queued up at the Capitol Theater, waiting to watch The Flying Tigers. Gen. Claire Chennault had his P-40 Warhawks painted to look like sharks, and they'd become a legend throughout the world as they supported the Chinese in the war against the Japs. I left the theater as pumped up as I was when I was sworn in at Devens. My question now was, how long would I have to wait before being called up?<br><br>As November moved into December and the first anniversary of Pearl Harbor, the home front was again called on to pull in its belt. Cans were to be collected, schools were to contribute one out of five typewriters, and the manufacture of ice cream was cut to save butter fat. By this time the oil crisis in New England was so bad that no oil would be sold to homes where the owners refused to convert to gas. Luckily, Dad had switched from coal to oil and, the previous spring, to gas, after braving the coldest winter in eight years. Now local stores were being closed for several days at a time to conserve fuel oil. Furthermore, if we didn't want to freeze to death, we were warned, we'd better consider doubling up with other families.<br><br>FDR, as commander in chief, had bigger problems. For here were railroad workers threatening to strike, all 350,000 of them, if they didn't get a 30 percent raise. And 1,500 workers at Bethlehem Steel Corporation went on strike, in violation of the no-strike pledge of all plants for the duration of the war. So the president cracked down and sent War Department production director William R. Knudsen out to tour the plants. When he got to Worcester he declared that "we must work like hell" if we intended to win this war.<br><br>Our home-front privations were little enough sacrifice as we learned of the continuing hits the Allies were taking in this, the start of our second year of war. On December 3 we were gripped with the news of the Allied invasion of North Africa. Despite German air supremacy there, the Allies claimed they sank eighteen Axis ships while losing sixteen. According to Churchill, the war was now entering its "tensest phase." On the 5th we learned that the Allies were softening up "the soft under-belly" of Europe, Italy. Our bombers were pounding the docks and railroad facilities at Naples, hitting a battleship and two cruisers without so much as a challenge from Italian fighters in the air. It was fast becoming clear to Hitler that, if it were left to the Italians, Italy's boot would indeed represent a "soft under-belly." So he stripped the Russian front of fighter planes to counter any Allied invasion from the Mediterranean, even as he ordered his Wehrmacht down the boot to reinforce the toe.</p><h2>American Prospects</h2><p>First published in 1987 to widespread critical acclaim and hailed by <i>People</i> magazine as one of the ten best books of the 1980s, Joel Sternfeld's startling visual chronicle is at once funny and despairing, calmly beautiful and grim. Sternfeld may be America's greatest fineart color photographer, and here his luxuriant landscapes are full of sly surprises and deadpan wit: a renegade elephant lies exhausted on a road; beached whales daintily punctuate a majestic seascape; a fireman buys pumpkins while a house burns behind him. Now published in an exquisite paper-bound edition with a new preface, these pictures carry even more weight than when they were first seen; they have the poignance and resonance of an America uneasy about its past and uncertain of its future.</p><p>Joel Sternfeld was born in New York City.

The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 - 2 February 1943) was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in the south-western Soviet Union. Marked by constant close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians by air raids, it is the single largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare. The heavy losses inflicted on the Wehrmacht make it arguably the most strategically decisive battle of the whole war. It was a turning point in the European theatre of World War II-the German forces never regained the initiative in the East and withdrew a vast military force from the West to replace their losses.</p><p></p><h2>The Zelator</h2><p>1st Arrow edition vg++ condition.

The wall between Science and Religion has not always been so high. While in the 21st century, we have become used to mechanical solar systems and Godless universes, in the early days of the scientific revolution, many scientists explored the natural world for spiritual reasons. This was especially true for Johannes Kepler, who discovered the three basic laws of planetary motion. He was in many ways the Protestant Galileo, persecuted for his support of the Copernican system. Along the way, a neighbour lady accused his mother of witchcraft, and Kepler abandoned his post as the Imperial mathematician for a time to defend her. James Connor, an author whose star is on the rise, tells the story of Kepler's life as a pilgrimage, a spiritual journey into the modern world through war and disease and terrible injustice, a journey reflected in the evolution of Kepler's geometrical model of the cosmos into a musical model, harmony into greater harmony. The leitmotif of the witch trial stitches the biography together and adds a third dimension to Kepler's life by setting his personal life deep within his own times. The acts of this trial, including Kepler's letters and the accounts of the witnesses, have been published in their original German dialects but have never before been translated into English. As Dava Sobel did as part of her work on <em>Galileo's Daughter</em>, Connor has translated the witch trial documents into English for the first time.</p><p> David Koch, the Deputy Principal Investigator for NASA's Kepler Mission, provides a foreword revealing Kepler's many contributions to the world of science. Kepler is a man whose name every student of science knows, an icon of the modern age, but few know anything the man himself. </p><p> </p></p><p><p>James A. Connor is the author of <em>Kepler's Witch: An Astronomer's Discovery of Cosmic Order Amid Religious War</em>, <em>Political Intrigue, and the Heresy Trial of His Mother</em> and <em>Silent Fire: Bringing the Spirituality of Silence to Everyday Life</em>. A former Jesuit priest, Connor is professor of English at Kean University in Union, New Jersey; he has also held teaching posts at St. Louis University and Gonzaga University. He is a director of studies at the Lessing Institute in Prague. He holds degrees in geoscience, philosophy, theology, and creative writing, and a Ph.D. in literature and science. He is a prize-winning essayist published widely in such places as <em>American Book Review</em>, <em>Traditional Home</em>, <em>Willow Springs</em>, <em>The Critic</em>, <em>The Iowa Review</em>, and <em>The Iowa Journal of Literary Studies</em>.</p>On his deathbed, one of history's greatest astronomers voiced no satisfaction over his achievements in advancing planetary physics but a great deal of frustration over his lifelong powerlessness to resolve religious conflict. A former Jesuit, Connor here probes the dark religious events that enshrouded the brilliant scientific career of Johannes Kepler. The forces of Reformation and Counter-Reformation repeatedly convulsed the European world in which Kepler pursued his pioneering research, but Connor chiefly scrutinizes the religious turmoil peculiar to Kepler's life. Readers see, for instance, how Kepler fought to maintain friendships with both Catholics and Protestants, how he struggled to harmonize his own sophisticated faith with his wife's simple piety, how he suffered when his intellectual openness cost him his cherished communion as a Lutheran, and, finally, how he jeopardized his reputation to defend an eccentric mother accused of witchcraft. Rich with new translations of Kepler's journals, poetry, and correspondence, this compelling narrative will leave readers wondering how a man so enmeshed in religious travail ever managed to penetrate the mystery of planetary orbits, to blaze a path toward calculus, and to formulate the founding principles of optics. But nothing will astound readers more than the way the religiously vexed Kepler persisted in interpreting his discoveries as evidence of the divine harmony in the universe! Connor indeed argues that precisely because he framed his science in the language of worship, Kepler has received less than his due from rationally minded scholars. This luminous biography will help remedy that injustice. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Anthony Thwaite. Claudia Hampton, a beautiful, famous writer, lies dying in hospital. But, as the nurses tend to her with quiet condescension, she is plotting her greatest work: &#39;a history of the world ... and in the process, my own&#39;. Gradually she re-creates the rich mosaic of her life and times, conjuring up those she has known. There is Gordon, her adored brother; Jasper, the charming, untrustworthy lover and father of Lisa, her cool, conventional daughter; and Tom, her one great love, both found and lost in wartime Egypt. Penelope Lively&#39;s Booker Prize-winning novel weaves an exquisite mesh of memories, flashbacks and shifting voices, in a haunting story of loss and desire. Penelope Lively (b. 1933) was born in Cairo. She has twice been shortlisted for the Booker Prize; once in 1977 for her first novel, The Road to Lichfield, and again in 1984 for According to Mark. She later won the 1987 Booker Prize for her highly acclaimed novel Moon Tiger. Her novels include Passing On, City of the Mind, Cleopatra&#39;s Sister and Heat Wave, and many are published by Penguin. If you enjoyed Moon Tiger, you might like L.P.

She is a popular writer for children and has won both the Carnegie Medal and the Whitbread Award. She was appointed CBE in the 2001 New Year&#39;s Honours List, and DBE in 2012. Penelope Lively lives in London.Lively recently won Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for this deeply moving, elegantly structured novel. The heroine is Claudia Hampton, an unconventional historian and former war correspondent who lies in a hospital bed dying of cancer. Forced inward, Claudia moves randomly across time and place to reconstruct the strata of her life. But "most lives have their core, their kernel, the vital centre"; Claudia's is the brief, tragic encounter she had in Egypt during the war with Tom Southern, a British tank officer on leave from battle. Tom's voice, along with those of her brother and daughter, joins Claudia's to shape a narrative that is a complex, intricately composed fugue. This haunting evocation of loss is Lively's finest achievement yet.Laurence Hull, Cannon Memorial Lib., Concord, N.C.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Blue Strawbery Cookbook: Cooking (Brilliantly) Without Recipes</h2><p>Cooking brilliantly imaginative American high cuisine without recipes.</p><p>James Haller is the chef of the Blue Strawbery restaurant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

A house or mansion of debased heritage and mixed architectural antecedents, several recent wings were of modern brick on old stone foundations, while others were cheap breeze blocks camouflaged in grey and green paint. A once-courtyard in the "U" of polyglot wings was now roofed over, its roof painted to match the surrounding terrain. Bedded at their bases in massive, steeply gabled end walls, twin minarets raised broken bulbous domes high over the landscape, their boarded windows glooming like hooded eyes. In keeping with the generally run-down aspect of the rest of the place, the upper sections of these towers were derelict, decayed asrotten fangs. From the air, the Chateau would seem a gaunt old ruin. But it was hardly that, even though the towers were not the only things in a state of decay.Outside the roofed courtyard stood a canopied ten-ton Army truck, the canvas flaps at its rear thrown back and its exhaust puffing acrid blue smoke into the frosty air. A KGB man, conspicuous in his "uniform" of felt hat and dark grey overcoat, stared in across the truck's lowered tailgate at its contents and shuddered. Hands thrust deep in his pockets, he turned to a second man dressed in the white smock of a technician and grimaced. "Comrade Krakovitch," he grunted, "what the hell are they? And what are they doing here?"Felix Krakovitch glanced at him, shook his head, said, "You wouldn't understand if I told you. And if you understood, you wouldn't believe." Like his ex-boss, Gregor Borowitz, Krakovitch considered all KGB low life-forms. He would keep information and assistance to the barest minimum--within certain limits of prudence and personal safety, of course. The KGB weren't much for forgiving and forgetting.The blocky Special Policeman shrugged, lit a stubby brown cigarette and drew deeply on its cardboard tube. "Try me anyway," he said. 'It's cold here but I am warm enough. See, when I go to report to Comrade Andropov--and I am sure I need not remind you of his Politburo status--he will want some answers, which is why I want answers from you. So we will stand out here until--""Zombies!" said Krakovitch abruptly. "Mummies! Men dead for four hundred years. You can tell that from their weapons, and--" For the first time he heard the insistent ringing of the telephone, turned towards the door in the corrugated iron fa�ade of the covered courtyard."Where are you going?" The KGB man came alive, took his hands out of his pockets. "Do you expect me to tell Yuri Andropov that the--the <i>mayhem</i>--here was doneby dead men?" He almost choked on the last two words, coughed long and loud, finally spat on the snow."Stand there long enough," Krakovitch said over his shoulder, "in those exhaust fumes, smoking that shredded rope, and you might as well climb in the truck with them!" He stepped through the door, let it slam shut behind him."Zombies?" The agent wrinkled his nose, looked again at the truckload of cadavers.He couldn't know it but they were Crimean Tartars, butchered en <i>masse</i> in 1579 by Russian reinforcements hastening to a ravaged Moscow. They had died and gone down in blood and mire and bog, to lie part-preserved in the peat of a low-lying field--and to come up again two nights ago to wage war on the Chateau! They had won that war, the Tartars and their young English leader, Harry Keogh, for after the fighting only five of the Chateau's defenders still lived. Krakovitch was one of them. Five out of thirty-three, and the only enemy casualty Harry Keogh himself. Amazing odds, unless one counted the Tartars. But one could hardly count them, for they had been dead before it started ...These were Krakovitch's thoughts as he entered what long ago had been a cobbled courtyard--now a large area of plastic-tiled floor, partitioned into airy conservatories, small apartments and laboratories--where E-Branch operatives had studied and practised their esoteric talents in comparative comfort, or whatever condition or environment best suited their work. Forty-eight hours ago the place had been immaculate; now it was a shambles, where bullet-holes patterned the partition walls and the effects of blast and fire could be seen on every hand. It was a wonder the place hadn't been burned to the ground, completely gutted.In a mainly cleared area--the so-called Investigation Control Room--a table had been erected and supported the ringing telephone. Krakovitch made his way towards it,pausing to drag aside a large piece of utility wall which partly blocked his path. Underneath, lying half-buried in crumbled plaster, broken glass and the crushed remains of a wooden chair, a human arm and hand lay like a huge grey salted slug. Its flesh was shrivelled, the colour of leather, and the bone where it projected in a knob at the shoulder was shiny white. It was almost a fossil. There'd be many more fragments such as this yet to be discovered, scattered throughout the Chateau, but apart from their repulsive looks they'd be harmless--now. Not so on the night of the horror. Krakovitch had seen portions like this one, without heads or brains to guide them, crawling, fighting, killing!He shuddered, moved the arm aside with his foot, went to the telephone. "Hello, Krakovitch?""Who?" the unknown caller snapped back. "Krakovitch? Are you in charge there?" It was a female voice, very efficient."I suppose I am, yes," Krakovitch answered. "What can I do for you?""For me, nothing. For the Party Leader, only he can say. He's been trying to contact you for the last five minutes!"Krakovitch was tired. He hadn't slept since the nightmare, doubted if he'd ever sleep again. He and the other four survivors, one of them a raving madman, had only come out of the security vault on Sunday morning, when the air was finished. Since then the others had made their statements, been sent home. The Chateau Bronnitsy was a High Security Establishment, so their stories wouldn't be for general consumption. In fact Krakovitch--being the only genuinely coherent member of the survivors--had demanded that the case <i>in toto</i> be sent direct to Leonid Brezhnev. That was Standing Orders anyway: Brezhnev was the top man, personally and directly responsible for E-Branch, despite the fact that he'd left all of it to Gregor Borowitz. But the branch had been important to the PartyLeader, and he'd seen everything that came out of it (or at least anything of any importance). Also, Borowitz must have told him quite a bit about the branch's paranormal work--literally ESPionage--so that Brezhnev should be at least part-qualified to pass judgement on what had happened here. Or so Krakovitch hoped. In any case, it had to be better than trying to explain it to Yuri Andropov!"Krakovitch?" the phone barked at him. (Was this really the Party Leader?)"Er, yes, sir, Felix Krakovitch. I was on Comrade Borowitz's staff.""Felix? Why tell me your first name? You expect me to call you by your first name?" The voice had a hard edge, but it also sounded like its owner was eating something mushy. Krakovitch had heard several of Brezhnev's infrequent speeches; this could only be him."I ... no, of course not, Comrade Party Leader." (How the hell did one <i>address</i> him?) "But I--""Listen, are you in charge there?""Yes, er, Comrade Party--""Forget all that stuff," Brezhnev rasped. "I don't need reminding who I am, just answers. Is there no one left who is senior to you?""No.""Anyone who's your equal?""Four of them, but one's a madman.""Eh?""He went mad when ... when it happened."There was a pause; then, the voice went on, a little less harshly: "Do you know Borowitz is dead?""Yes. A neighbour found him in his dacha at Zhukovka. The neighbour was ex-KGB and got in touch with Comrade Andropov, who sent a man here. He's here now.""I know another name," Brezhnev's thick, gurgling voice continued. "Boris Dragosani. What of him?""Dead," and before Krakovitch could check his tongue, "thank God!""Eh? You're glad one of your comrades is dead?""I ... yes, I'm glad." Krakovitch was too tired to answer in any way but truthfully, straight from the heart. "I think he was probably part of it; at least, I believe he brought it down on us. His body is still here. Also the bodies of our other dead--and that of Harry Keogh, a British agent, we think. And also--""The Tartars?" Brezhnev was quiet now.Krakovitch sighed. The man wasn't a slave to convention after all. "Yes, but no longer ... animate," he answered.Another pause. "Krakovitch--er, Felix, did you say? --I've read the statements of the other three. Are they true? No chance of an error, mass hypnotism or delusion or something? Was it really as bad as that?""They are true--no chance of an error--it was as bad as that.""Felix, listen. Take over there. I mean you, take over. I don't want E-Branch shut down. It has been more than beneficial to our security. And Borowitz was more valuable to me personally than many of my generals would ever believe. So I want the branch rebuilt. And it looks like you've got the job."Krakovitch felt like a swatted fly: knocked off his feet, lost for words. "I ... Comrade ... I mean--""Can you do it?"Krakovitch wasn't crazy. It was the chance of a lifetime. "It will take years--but yes, I'll try to do it.""Good! But if you take it on, you'll have to do more than just try, Felix. Let me know what you need and I'll see you get it. The first thing <i>I</i> want is answers. But I'm the only one who gets those answers, you understand? This one has to be screwed down. It mustn't leak. And that reminds me--did you say there was someone from the KGB with you right now?""He's outside, in the grounds.""Get him," Brezhnev's voice was harsh again. "Bring him to the phone. Let me speak to him at once!"Krakovitch started back across the floor, but at that moment the door opened to admit the man in question. He squared his shoulders, looked at Krakovitch in a surly, narrow-eyed manner, said, "We haven't finished, Comrade.""I'm afraid we have," Krakovitch felt shored up, buoyant as a cork. It must be his fatigue beginning to work on him. "There's someone on the phone for you.""Eh? For me?" The other pushed by him. "Who is it, someone from the office?""Not sure," Krakovitch lied. "Head office, I think."The KGB man frowned at him, scowled, snatched up the phone from the table. "Yanov here. What is it? I'm busy down here, and--"His face immediately underwent rapid changes of expression and colour. He jerked visibly and almost staggered. Only the phone seemed to be holding him up. "Yessir! Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir! Yes, yessir! No, sir. I will, sir. Yes, sir. But I--no, sir. <i>Yessir!</i>" He looked sick, held out the phone for Krakovitch, glad to be rid of it.As Krakovitch took the instrument from him, the agent hissed viciously: "Fool! That's the Party Leader!"Krakovitch let his eyes go big and round, made an "O" with his mouth. Then he said casually into the mouthpiece, "Krakovitch here," and at once held the phone towards the KGB man, let him hear Brezhnev's voice:"Felix? Has that prick gone yet?"It was the Special Policeman's turn to make an "O.""He's going now," Krakovitch answered. He nodded sharply towards the door. "Out! And do try to remember what the Party Leader told you. For your own good."The KGB operative shook his head dazedly, licked his lips, headed for the door. He was still white-faced. At the door he turned, thrust his chin out. "I--" he began."Goodbye, comrade," Krakovitch dismissed him. "Nowhe's gone," he finally confirmed, after the door had slammed shut."Good! I don't want them interfering. They didn't fool about with Gregor, and I don't want them fooling with you. Any problems from them and you get straight back to me!""Yes, sir.""Now, here's what I want ... But first, tell me--have the branch records survived?""Almost everything's intact, except for our agents. There's damage, a lot. But records, installations, the Chateau itself--in decent order, I think. Manpower's a different story. I'll tell you what we have left. There's myself and three other survivors, six more on holiday in various parts, three fairly good telepaths on permanent duty in connection with the British, American and French embassies, and another four or five field agents out in the world. With twenty-eight dead, we've lost almost two-thirds of our staff. Most of the best men are gone.""Yes, yes," Brezhnev was impatient. "Manpower is important, that's why I asked about records. Recruitment! That's your first task. It will take a long time, I know, but get on it. Old Gregor once told me that you have special sorts who can spot others with the talent, right?""I've still got one good spotter, yes," Krakovitch answered, giving an unconscious nod. "I'll start using him at once. And I'll commence studying Comrade Borowitz's records, of course.""Good! Now then, see how quickly you can get that place cleaned up. Those Tartar corpses: burn 'em! And don't let anyone see them. I don't care how that's done, but do it. Then put in a comprehensive works chit for repairs on the Chateau. I'll have it actioned at once. In fact, I'll have a man here, on this number or another number he'll give you, who you can contact at any time for anything. That's from right now, You'll keep him informed and he'll keep me informed. He'll be your onlyboss, except he'll deny you nothing. See how highly I prize you, Felix? Right, that should get things started. As for the rest: Felix Krakovitch, I want to know <i>how</i> this happened! Are they that far ahead, the British, the Americans, the Chinese? I mean, how <i>could</i> one man, this Harry Keogh, do so much damage?""Comrade," Krakovitch answered, "you mentioned Boris Dragosani. I once watched him work. He was a necromancer. He sniffed out the secrets of dead men. I've seem him do things to corpses that gave me nightmares for months! You ask how Harry Keogh could do so much damage? From what little I've so far been able to discover, it seems he was capable of almost anything. Telepathy, teleportation, even Dragosani's own necromancy. He was their best. But I think Keogh was many steps ahead of Dragosani. It's one thing to torture dead men and drain their secrets from their blood and brains and guts, but it's quite another to call them up out of their graves and make them fight for you!""Teleportation?" For a moment the Party Leader was thoughtful, then came on impatient: "You know, the more I hear the less I'm inclined to believe. I <i>wouldn't</i> believe, except I saw Borowitz's results. And how else am I to explain a couple of hundred Tartar corpses, eh? But right now ... I've spent enough time with you on this. I have other things to do. In five more minutes I'll have your go-between on this line.

From antiquity to the present, expert painters-including abstract modern masters such as Paul Klee and Jackson Pollock-have conveyed harmony through the mathematics of spatial division, ultimately giving geometry a crucial role as the foundation upon which these classics were built. For over half a century, <i>The Painter's Secret Geometry</i> has been a seminal work for students of art history and composition. Now this popular, rich analysis is back in print for today's artists and historians.</p></p><p><p>This richly illustrated examination of visual arts in the European tradition shows how the great masters employed the "golden mean" and other geometrical patterns to compose their paintings. Author Charles Bouleau explores a tremendous variety of ancient and modern works: the Parthenon friezes, Italian mosaics, the Bayeux Tapestry, and Gothic stonemasons' marks of France and Germany as well as paintings by Picasso, Kandinsky, Klee, and Pollock. His insightful expositions cast new light on such well-known works as Raphael's "The School of Athens," Botticelli's "Birth of Venus," Rubens' "Descent from the Cross," and Renoir's "Le Moulin de la Galette."<br>Advancing step by step through each painter's vast body of work, the survey highlights new contributions from each period and artist. Every analysis is conducted according to strict methods, placing the work within the intellectual atmosphere of its time. Original, informative, and stimulating, <i>The Painter's Secret Geometry</i> reveals the framework of art as well as its most profound and secret poetry. This new edition of the cult classic is a vade mecum for any student of art history or artistic composition.<br>Dover (2014) republication of the edition originally published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc., New York, 1963.<br>See every Dover book in print at<br><b>www.doverpublications.com</b></p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Gangster Capitalism: The United States and the Globalization of Organized Crime</h2><p>Everyone knows what organized crime is. Each year dozens of feature films, hundreds of books, and thousands of news stories explain to an eager public that organized crime is what gangsters do. Closely knit, ethnically distinct, and ruthlessly efficient, these mafias control the drugs trade, people trafficking and other serious crimes. If only states would take the threat seriously and recognize the global nature of modern organized crime, the FBI&#39;s success against the Italian mafia could be replicated throughout the world. The wicked trade in addictive drugs could be brought to a halt. The trouble is, as Woodiwiss demonstrates in shocking and surprising detail, what everyone knows about organized crime is pretty much completely wrong. In reality the most important figures in organized crime are employees of multinational companies, politicians and bureaucrats. Gangsters are certainly a problem, but much of their strength comes from attempts to prohibit the market for certain drugs. Even here they are minor players when compared with the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that selectively enforce prohibition and profit from it. Woodiwiss shows how respectable businessmen and revered statesmen have seized these opportunities in an orgy of fraud and illegal violence</p><p>Michael Woodiwiss lectures on American history at the University of the West of England.

Through poignant reflection and thorough investigation of the myths, rituals, economics, and politics of African American mourning and burial practices, Karla FC Holloway finds that ways of dying are just as much a part of black identity as ways of living. Gracefully interweaving interviews, archival research, and analyses of literature, film, and music, Holloway shows how the vulnerability of African Americans to untimely death is inextricably linked to how black culture represents itself and is represented. <br>With a focus on the &#x201c;death-care&#x201d; industry&#x2014;black funeral homes and morticians, the history of the profession and its practices&#x2014;Holloway examines all facets of the burial business, from physicians, hospital chaplains, and hospice administrators, to embalming- chemical salesmen, casket makers, and funeral directors, to grieving relatives. She uses narrative, photographs, and images to summon a painful history of lynchings, white rage and riot, medical malpractice and neglect, executions, and neighborhood violence. Specialized caskets sold to African Americans, formal burial photos of infants, and deathbed stories, unveil a glimpse of the graveyards and burial sites of African America, along with burial rituals and funeral ceremonies. <br>Revealing both unexpected humor and anticipated tragedy, Holloway tells a story of the experiences of black folk in the funeral profession and its clientele. She also reluctantly shares the story of her son and the way his death moved her research from page to person.<br>In the conclusion, which follows a sermon delivered by Maurice O. Wallace at the funeral for the author&#x2019;s son, Bem, Holloway strives to commemorate&#x2014;through observation, ceremony, and the calling of others to remembrance and celebration.</p><p>&#x201c;Karla Holloway writes about a central and little-explored American phenomenon with a wide and patient breadth of knowledge and a startlingly profound personal depth. It feels like a book as durable as a well-shaped stone&#x2014;as reliable, useful and finally consoling, however hard to bear.&#x201d;&#x2014;Reynolds Price <p>&#x201c;Beginning with the tragic loss of her son, Karla Holloway poignantly examines how race not only affects the meaning of black lives, but their deaths as well.&#x201d;&#x2014;Paula Giddings, author of When and Where I Enter: The Impact of Black Women on Race and Sex in America</p>"Passed On explores a century's worth of experience with black death and dying. . . My travels have traced the story this book tells. I have wandered through exhibits in a museum of the funeral industry . . .I have visited funeral directors and morticians . . . I have searched early-century graveyards and late-century cemeteries . . . I have consulted archives and manuscripts . . . I have talked with physicians, casket manufacturers, hospice administrators, makers of 'funeral' garments, palliative care teams, embalming-chemical businessmen, neighborhood ministers, and neighborhood residents.<p>"When I started working on this book . . . I had not imagined how this would be connected to me in such a visceral and personal way. . . that the narrative of Passed On, which invaded my serenity many years ago (well before my son's life took its tragic, final turn), would find its articulation in this manner. I do not tell his story for judgment or absolution. I tell it instead because it too has the characteristics of an 'incident report' that is, finally, community property."--From the Introduction</p></p><h2>The Emily Dickinson Handbook</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

If you&#39;re cute and female, look me up, my address is in wizard-run TunFaire, where the paranormal plays daily. Look at my partner. Someone stuck a knife in him centuries ago, and he&#39;s been sedentary ever since. Dead, but not dumb, if you get my drift. And there&#39;s all these supernatural races clogging the streets-elves, trolls, pixies, ogres, dwarves, and some of the strangest are among my friends. Even they bring trouble, and when trouble comes knocking, don&#39;t open the door.You think I&#39;d learn. Maybe that&#39;s why I got roped into the case in Angry Lead Skies. My bulky friend Playmate talked me into protecting Kip Prose, an annoying kid touched by brilliance and a bit of paranormal ability, whom he claimed was being threatened by skinny gray creatures with bulgy black eyes. According to Kip, the attackers weren&#39;t after him at all-just trying to get to his friends Lastyr and Noodiss. But before I could get him to explain who they were, Kip was abducted, and the chase began....In Whispering Nickel Idols, trouble came from two sources: a streetwise priestess and her bucket of kittens, part of the ancient prophecy of the cult of A-Lat (curse this god-plagued city!). And a message from Harvester Temisk, mouthpiece of Chodo Contague, kingpin of kingpins, who slumbered in coma-land while his beautiful, psychotic daughter ran the Outfit. Temisk believed someone was deliberately keeping the Boss helpless and wanted me to snoop around. Then Chodo up and vanished. Add to that a mysterious plague of burning deaths and the fact that suddenly everyone was trying to kill me, I had plenty to figure out....</p><p></p><h2>Dilvish, the Damned</h2><p>Strong spine with light wear and creasing, and small repair.

Poet, novelist, critic, artist, actor, film-maker, Cocteau was also one of the greatest dramatists Europe has produced, with over a dozen plays which are frequently revived, not only in France, but in translation in many other countries. For this collection, fine translations of four full-length plays, one short play, and the &#x201c;Speaker's Text" for the Cocteau-Stravinsky opera Oedipus Rex have been selected. The longer plays (The Infernal Machine, Orpheus, Bacchus, Knights of the Round Table) are re-creations of classic myth and legend&#x2015;poetic and highly original interpretations of certain timeless themes which have inspired great drama through the ages. The Eiffel Tower Wedding Party is, by contrast, merely a "curtain-raiser," but remarkable as un jeu d'esprit, revealing the wit and psychological penetration for which Cocteau is famous.</p><p>Jean Cocteau (1889&#x2013;1963) was an avant-garde French writer, designer, filmmaker and boxing manager.</p><h2>Ben Archer and the Cosmic Fall: (The Alien Skill Series, Book 1)</h2><p><p><strong>A BOY WITH AN ALIEN POWER.</strong></p><p><strong></strong><br></p><p>&#x201c;The thing is, it wasn&#x2019;t meteors that fell into the woods that night.

He was a charismatic preacher with idealistic beliefs, and he quickly filled his pews with an audience eager to hear his sermons on social justice. As Jones&#x2019;s behavior became erratic and his message more ominous, his followers leaned on each other to recapture the sense of equality that had drawn them to his church. But even as the congregation thrived, Jones made it increasingly difficult for members to leave. By the time Jones moved his congregation to a remote jungle in Guyana and the US government began to investigate allegations of abuse and false imprisonment in Jonestown, it was too late. <br> <br><i>A Thousand Lives </i>is the story of Jonestown as it has never been told. <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Julia Scheeres drew from tens of thousands of recently declassified FBI documents and audiotapes, as well as rare videos and interviews, to piece together an unprecedented and compelling history of the doomed camp, focusing on the people who lived there. <br> <br>The people who built Jonestown wanted to forge a better life for themselves and their children. In South America, however, they found themselves trapped in Jonestown and cut off from the outside world as their leader goaded them toward committing &#x201c;revolutionary suicide&#x201d; and deprived them of food, sleep, and hope. Vividly written and impossible to forget, <i>A Thousand Lives </i>is a story of blind loyalty and daring escapes, of corrupted ideals and senseless, haunting loss.<b></b></p><p><br>Had I walked by 1859 Geary Boulevard in San Francisco when Peoples Temple was in full swing, I certainly would have been drawn to the doorway.<br> <br>I grew up in a strict Christian family with an adopted black brother; race and religion were the dominant themes of my childhood. In our small Indiana town, David and I often felt self-conscious walking down the street together. Strangers scowled at us, and sometimes called us names. I wrote about the challenges of our relationship in my memoir, <i>Jesus Land</i>. <br> <br>Suffice it to say, David and I would have been thrilled and amazed by Peoples Temple, a church where blacks and whites worshipped side by side, the preacher taught social justice instead of damnation, and the gospel choir transported the congregation to a loftier realm. We longed for such a place.<br> <br>Unfortunately, the laudable aspects of Peoples Temple have been forgotten in the horrifying wake of Jonestown.<br> <br>I stumbled onto writing this book by accident. I was writing a satirical novel about a charismatic preacher who takes over a fictional Indiana town, when I remembered Jim Jones was from Indiana, and Googled him. I learned that the FBI had released fifty thousand pages of documents, including diaries, meeting notes, and crop reports, as well as one thousand audiotapes that agents found in Jonestown after the massacre, and that no one had used this material to write a comprehensive history of the doomed community. Once I started digging through the files, I couldn't tear myself away.<br> <br>It was easy to set my novel aside. I believe that true stories are more powerful, in a meaningful, existential way, than made-up ones. Learning about other peoples' lives somehow puts one's own life in sharper relief.<br> <br>Aside from race and religion, there were other elements of the Peoples Temple story that resonated with me. When David and I were teenagers, our parents sent us to a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic that had some uncanny parallels with Jonestown. I could empathize with the residents' sense of isolation and desperation.<br> <br>You won't find the word <i>cult</i> in this book, unless I'm directly citing a source that uses the word. My aim here is to help readers understand the reasons that people were drawn to Jim Jones and his church, and how so many of them ended up dying in a mass-murder suicide on November 18, 1978. The word <i>cult</i> only discourages intellectual curiosity and empathy. As one survivor told me, nobody joins a cult. <br> <br>To date, the Jonestown canon has veered between sensational media accounts and narrow academic studies. In this book, I endeavor to tell the Jonestown story on a grander, more human, scale.<br> &nbsp;<br> Julia Scheeres<br> &nbsp;Berkeley, California, March 24, 2011Julia Scheeres is the author of <i>New York Times</i> bestselling memoir <i>Jesus Land</i>.

It is only the first such weapon: a second is being built, and this time it might very well destroy the entire planet. Desperately trying to save the Earth and her people, Starfleet must, in a heartbeat, change its mission from one of peaceful scientific exploration to one of military service.</p><p>There is only one ship fast enough to stop construction of this new weapon: the Starship Enterprise.&#x2122; But its crew can't do it alone. Captain Jonathan Archer accepts aboard his ship a contingent of Military Assault Command Operations personnel: battle-hardened soldiers known as MACOs. </p><p>Starfleet and the MACOs are two different services now sharing a common goal, but they are divided as to how to reach it. It is a culture clash that echoes across the centuries of military service. The men and women now aboard Enterprise know they must succeed in working together or the price will be paid in the blood of innocents.

Through many trials, difficulties, temptations, and sorrows, he comes to rely solely on Christ for his every need. Written in prison, it served as an epistle of encouragement to his congregation.

Never has there been a more calculated attempt to ruin an entire reign in the eyes of posterity. Procopius writes of:<br> . . . How the Great General Belisarius was hoodwinked by his wife, whose lover became a monk.<br> . . . How Theodora, most depraved of all empresses, won Justinian's love.<br> . . . How she saved five hundred harlots from a life of sin, made off with her own natural son, and other curious incidents of her passion.</p><p>The last major ancient historian, Byzantine scholar PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA (c. 500-565) traveled with the army of Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I as a military adviser, and published his accounts of the wars the emperor fought in his eight-volume History of the Wars. <p> But what was the real story of life with Justinian, his wife, Theodora, and Justinian's greatest general, Belisarius? Procopius' Secret History was so scandalous that he withheld it during his lifetime, and in fact, it was not published until 1623. In this 1927 translation by RICHARD ATWATER (1892-1998), considered the best available, Procopius gives us all the scoop on: </p><p> * how the great general Belisarius was hoodwinked by his wife * how Theodora humiliated the conqueror of Africa and Italy * how Justinian created a new law permitting him to marry a courtesan * Justinian and Theodora: fiends in human form * the deceptive affability and piety of a tyrant * what happened to those who fell out of favor with Theodora * and much more. </p><p> An enthralling read, this curio of ancient history will fascinate anyone interested in tales of royal intrigue.</p>Procopius was the greatest historian of the Later Roman Empire. He was the author of an account of the Persian, Vandal, and Gothic Wars called&nbsp;<i>The History of the Wars</i>, and of&nbsp;<i>Buildings of Justinian</i>. His&nbsp;<i>Secret History</i>&nbsp;lay unpublished until 1623. The present translation by Richard Attwater is the only one to stand as a work of literature in its own right.</p><h2>His Invention So Fertile: A Life of Christopher Wren</h2><p>In <em>His Invention So Fertile</em>, Adrian Tinniswood offers the first biography of Christopher Wren in a generation. It is a book that reveals the full depth of Wren's multifaceted genius, not only as one of the greatest architects who ever lived--the designer of St. Paul's Cathedral--but as an influential seventeenth-century scientist.<br> Tinniswood writes with insight and flair as he follows Wren from Wadham College, Oxford, through the turmoil of the English Civil War, to his role in helping to found the Royal Society--the intellectual and scientific heart of seventeenth-century England. The reader discovers that the great architect was initially an astronomer who was also deeply interested in medicine, physics, and mathematics. Family connections pulled him into architecture, with a commission to restore the chapel at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Tinniswood deftly follows Wren's rise as architect, capturing the atmosphere of Restoration London, as old Royalists scrambled for sinecures from Charles II and Wren learned the art of political infighting at court, finally becoming Surveyor of the Royal Works-the King's engineer. Most important, the author recounts the intriguing story of the building of St. Paul's. The Great Fire of 1666--vividly recreated in Tinniswood's narrative--left London a smoldering husk. Wren played a central role in reshaping the city, culminating with St. Paul's, his masterpiece--though he had to steer between King and cathedral authorities to get his radical, domed design built. As the Enlightenment dawned in England, Wren's magnificent dome rose above London, soon to become an icon of London and world architecture. <br> One of the most influential architects in history, Christopher Wren comes vividly to life in this fittingly grand biography.</p><p>"If you seek his monument, look around," commands Adrian Tinniswood in his scholarly but elegantly entertaining biography of Christopher Wren (1632-1723). "As an architect, he changed the face of England and the course of architectural history." Tinniswood describes with appreciation and discernment Wren's greatest buildings: "the bubble of unexampled lightness that is St. Stephen Walbrook" church, the additions to Hampton Court, and of course London's majestic St. Paul's Cathedral, a symbol of British faith and courage throughout the centuries. These structures were political as well as architectural achievements, and Tinniswood nicely captures the discretion, ruthlessness, and carefully cultivated connections that enabled Wren to survive the Civil War, get himself named Royal Surveyor, hang on to the job under five monarchs, and get designs approved and money wheedled out of a reluctant parliament. Tinniswood pays equally intelligent attention to Wren's early career as an esteemed Oxford astronomy professor and charter member of the Royal Society (and its president from 1681-3). He writes wittily about the quirks of Wren and such peers as Newton and Bernini, capturing the intensely personal nature of 17th-century public culture, and he (sparingly) offers his opinions in a way that enhances our understanding of the period. "I want my heroes to be people, not ideas," Tinniswood writes, after describing a squabble at the Royal Society. This sparkling biography reveals Wren as a human being without detracting from the heroic nature of his accomplishments. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Christopher Wren (1632-1723) was the greatest architect Britain has ever known. But more than that - he was a founder of the Royal Society, he mapped the moon and the stars, investigated the problem of longitude and the rings of Saturn, and carried out groundbreaking experiments into the circulation of the blood. Adrian Tinniswood also shows us the man behind the legend - married and widowed twice - scrambling over building sites, going to the theatre and drinking in coffee-houses. And he shows clearly why Wren remains a cultural icon as both a creation and a creator of the world he lived in.</p><h2>Flight of the Buffalo: Soaring to Excellence, Learning to Let Employees Lead</h2><p>In Search of Excellence influenced the managers of the last decade. Now, a new book gives leadership insights to meet the unprecedented demands of the 1990s.<br>Ralph Stayer is a courageous, pioneering CEO and the hero of Tom Peters' management video "The Leadership Alliance." James Belasco is a visionary, renowned consultant and author of the groundbreaking business book Teaching the Elephant to Dance. Together these two authors inspire you with far-sighted, revolutionary concepts and guide you with nuts-and-bolts prescriptions ... as they show you how to rise above the old ways of 1980s to soar to new levels of business success in the tough times ahead.<br>Belasco and Stayer explain why executives are unable to change their organizations quickly enough. Weighted down by old leadership paradigms, managers act like head buffalo, charging blindly ahead in fits and starts, urging the herd to follow. But hard-driving managers and their herds suffer the same fate as the buffalo of the plains: they are outmaneuvered by the more nimble, quick-thinking competition and predators in today's fast-paced global economic landscape.<br>Drawing upon their own highly successful business careers, Belasco and Stayer detail the new leadership role for executives. They call their managerial ethic Leading the Journey. In their model of the new, highly flexible organization, everyone is focused on delighting customers. The manager learns and grows while responding to changing circumstances. Instead of a herd, people become more like a flight of self-directed geese flying in formation. Everyone knows the common direction, is willing to assume leadership when necessary, and can rearrange the structure when the needs of the customer demand it. Individuals start to do their jobs better not because some leader orders it, but because they want to excel. In other words, letting employees lead produces new levels of excellence that benefit everyone.<br>Then Flight of the Buffalo demonstrates how this new leadership model can be applied directly to the most pressing business decisions. From two people who have actually done it you learn how to set value-added prices, identify and dominate profitable niche markets, anticipate the future and prepare for it, and set up bonus and profit sharing plans that really motivate and measure productivity in even the most difficult times.<br>Far removed from today's gimmicky how-to business books, Flight of the Buffalo is a mature work from two extraordinary business minds - a book meant for those who are ready to enter a new era of business success.</p><p>James A. Belasco is a professor, writer, consultant, and entrepreneur. Ralph C. Stayer is the former CEO of Johnsonville Foods, and author of the influential article &#39;How I Learned to Let My Workers Lead&#39; for the Harvard Business Review.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with TEACHING THE ELEPHANT TO DANCE.]--In these companion audiobooks, Belasco offers practical solutions to managing change and empowering employees in any organization. His authoritative yet personal tone is stimulating and encouraging. Using animal analogies such as shackled elephants and loyal-to-the-leader buffaloes to represent outmoded management styles, these audiobooks are paced like the gazelle Belasco refers to as the leadership style most likely to succeed. Quick and ever-changing, the gazelle doesn't wait for trouble, it springs to action. Belasco's performance is rapid but well-paced, offering many questions for leaders to ponder and tried-and-true strategies that help organizations succeed. Focusing on and living the vision is clearly demonstrated in these lively audiobooks.

In <i>Afro-Cuban Tales</i> this world comes to teeming life, introducing English-speaking readers to a realm of tenuous boundaries between the natural and the supernatural, deities and mortals, the spiritual and the seemingly inanimate. <p>Here readers will find a vibrant, imaginative record of African culture transplanted to Cuba and transformed over time, a passionate and subversive alternative to the dominant Western culture of the Americas. In this charmed realm of myth and legend, imaginative flights, and hard realities, Cabrera shows us a world turned upside down. In this domain guinea hens can make dour Asturians and the king of Spain dance; little fat cooking pots might prepare their own meals; the pope can send encyclicals about pumpkins; and officials can be defeated by the shrewdness of turtles. The first English translation of one of the most important writers on African culture in the Americas, the collection provides a fascinating view of how African traditions, myths, stories, and religions traveled to the New World&#x2014;of how, in their tales, Africans in the Americas created a New World all their own.</p></p><p>Lydia Cabrera (1899&#x2013;1991) was a legendary Cuban ethnographer of Afro-Cuban culture and the author of many books, including <i>El Monte</i> and <i>Vocabulario Congo</i>.&nbsp;Alberto Hern�ndez-Chiroldes is a professor and chair of the Spanish department at Davidson College. Lauren Yoder is James Sprunt Professor of French at Davidson College. Isabel Castellanos is one of the foremost scholars on Afro-Cuban culture.&#34;A marvelous book, with emphasis on marvel as magical. No wonder Cabrera is seen as one of the writers who planted the seed for magical realism.&#34;-Danilo H. Figueredo, Multicultural Review -- Danilo H.

At the age of thirteen, Little Stevie Wonder had millions of fans dancing to the number-one song in the nation. <br><br>Little Stevie Wonder is the true story of a boy who lost his sight shortly after birth, grew up in Detroit, Michigan, and became one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most creative and influential musicians&#x2014;an instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, musical innovator, and cultural activist. <br><br>Here in Quincy Troupe&#x2019;s joyful poem and Lisa Cohen&#x2019;s vibrant art is an uplifting celebration of life, peace, and music.</p><p>Quincy Troupe is the author of fourteen books, including seven volumes of poetry. He coauthored Miles: The Autobiography, which won an American Book Award, and wrote Miles and Me: A Memoir of Miles Davis. Quincy lives in New York City with his wife, Margaret. This is his second book for children.Gr. 2-4. Singing sensation Wonder gets an upbeat treatment in this stylish picture book. Troupe uses one of Wonder's signature songs--"Isn't She Lovely"--as a link to his own free verse: "Isn't he lovely, / this small blind boy, thinking of his fingertips? / Snapping those fingers before unseeing eyes." Mostly, the text works well, capturing the intensity of Wonder's music and the excitement of its evocative words: "His hands caress his harmonica, / his fingertips and breath pulling sweet music--like magic--from that old blues instrument of wood and polished steel." But some repeated lines are hyperbolic (Stevie was "born to love everyone"), and the insertion of straight biographical information is awkward. The acrylic artwork, however, is as dynamic as Wonder's music. Bold, pure colors and big, yet simple shapes pop from the pages as the pictures track Wonder from boy "genius" to mustachioed adult with beaded cornrows. Wonder's trademark sunglasses sometimes emit rainbows, an effective way of putting his disability in the larger context of his life. An author's note tells more about Wonder's life, and a CD, not available with the galley, offers two songs. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Are the girls okay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re fine,&#x201d; I call back automatically, staring into the downstairs bathroom mirror. I give one final tug on my tie, walk out of the bathroom, and step over the baby gate that guards the living-room entrance, separating that space from the rest of our small house like a barbed-wire fence around a POW camp. I survey the scene. <br>Katie is hunched over her play stove in a corner of the room, rummaging through plastic pots and pans and muttering to herself. Her five-year-old face is set in fierce concentration, and I glimpse what family and friends often comment on but that I myself rarely acknowledge out loud: Except for her dark black hair, which today is set in pigtails, Katie is the spitting image of me&#x2014;green eyes, an elongated face, and prominent ears. Meanwhile, a short distance away, Annabelle observes Katie serenely from her baby walker, thinking about whatever it is that ten-month-olds think about. She looks every bit as much like her mother as Katie looks like me, with straight, dark black hair, matching dark eyes, and a small nose. <br>Annabelle spots me, smiles adoringly, bangs happily on the narrow plastic shelf in front of her, bounces up and down, and waves like she hasn&#x2019;t seen me in months. I wave back like an idiot, pumping my hand back and forth with childish enthusiasm. The waving thing never gets old at this age, and I love it. &#x201c;Hi, &#x2019;Bella. Hi, sweetie.&#x201d; <br>Katie spins around. &#x201c;Daddy!&#x201d; she shrieks, running over and wrapping herself around my leg. I love that, too. Who wouldn&#x2019;t? Sure, they&#x2019;re a pain in the ass sometimes&#x2014;okay, practically <i>all</i> of the time&#x2014;but I can&#x2019;t imagine why anyone would not want to have kids. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m making dinner!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, boy. Show me.&#x201d; <br>She disengages herself from my leg, takes me by the hand, and leads me to the play stove. She solemnly spoons some white Styrofoam peanuts, the kind used as packing material in shipping boxes, from a plastic pot and into a small bowl, which she then hands to me. I poke its contents suspiciously and hold up one of the thumb-sized peanuts. <br>&#x201c;Where did these come from?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Mommy&#x2019;s box.&#x201d; She gestures toward an open cardboard box sitting near the front door, a recent purchase from an online store. A few of the peanuts lie scattered on the floor around it, carelessly strewn across the cracked linoleum. &#x201c;Eat, Daddy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Katie, you shouldn&#x2019;t be playing with these. They&#x2019;re too small for Annabelle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But &#x2019;Bella likes them.&#x201d; <br>My stomach does a queasy flip. &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;&#x2019;Bella likes them&#x2019;?&#x201d; I turn sharply to face Annabelle, realizing that she hasn&#x2019;t made a single sound, not so much as a gurgle or a raspberry, since I came into the room, and that her cheeks are puffed out, like a chipmunk with a bunch of nuts tucked in its mouth. She smiles at me again, and her lips part slightly, revealing a glimpse of white Styrofoam. <br>Annabelle bears my frantic plucking of all of the peanuts&#x2014;and there are <i>a lot</i> of them&#x2014;from her mouth with grace and equanimity, never once crying or resisting. When I&#x2019;m done, I hand her a plastic rattle, which she shoves in her mouth as if nothing happened, and squat down next to Katie, who&#x2019;s flipping calmly through a picture book. <br>&#x201c;Katie. You shouldn&#x2019;t have put those things in &#x2018;Bella&#x2019;s mouth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because they could have hurt her.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; A hint of defiance has crept into her voice. <br>&#x201c;She could have swallowed them and gotten sick.&#x201d; <br>Her lower jaw juts forward. &#x201c;&#x2019;Bella&#x2019;s not sick. She <i>liked</i> my dinner.&#x201d; <br> <i>Hard to argue with that.</i> I&#x2019;m trying to frame a suitable but firm response that doesn&#x2019;t involve complex descriptions of human-respiratory-tract anatomy when the doorbell rings. I check my watch. Right on time. As usual. &#x201c;Just&nbsp;&#x2026; don&#x2019;t do it again, Katie,&#x201d; I say lamely, rising to my feet. <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s already flipping pages in her picture book. <br>I grab the box full of the Styrofoam peanuts, shove it in a nearby closet, and open the front door to find my mother-in-law staring up at me, steely-eyed and unsmiling. <br>&#x201c;Hi, Mrs. Kim.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Steven.&#x201d; She steps across the threshold. I hesitate, and then awkwardly bend over to hug her. She wraps her arms around my waist and lightly pats my back once before quickly withdrawing. She steps back and stares at me coldly. <br>I shift my weight and cough. &#x201c;I, um&nbsp;&#x2026; We really appreciate you watching Katie and Annabelle tonight for us, Mrs. Kim.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome, Steven.&#x201d; <br>Like a knee-high rocket, Katie launches herself at my mother-in-law, grabbing her by the leg and screaming with laughter. Annabelle beams and bounces furiously up and down in her walker. <br>Mrs. Kim&#x2019;s face blossoms into a broad smile. &#x201c;Oh my goodness! What a wonderful greeting!&#x201d; With Katie still affixed to her leg, she gingerly steps into the room and, with a strength that defies her petite frame, scoops up Katie in one arm and Annabelle in the other. They giggle happily as she whispers to them in rapid-fire Korean. <br>Sally appears at the bottom of the stairs, her slim figure tucked into a sleek black cocktail dress, looking harried but elegant as she snaps a pearl earring into place. &#x201c;Hi, Mom. Thanks for coming over.&#x201d; She pecks her mother on the cheek, and they confer briefly on bath, dinner, and bed for the girls. &#x201c;We should be back by ten.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where are you going tonight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to a cocktail party for Steve&#x2019;s work before grabbing some dinner.&#x201d; <br>Her mother nods approvingly. &#x201c;Good. You deserve a night out.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m standing right there, but Mrs. Kim addresses Sally as if they&#x2019;re the only two people in the room. <br>&#x201c; <i>Good-bye,</i> Mom.&#x201d; We hug and kiss Katie and Annabelle good night, and a short while later we&#x2019;re in our sky blue Toyota Sienna minivan headed for my boss&#x2019;s house. <br>&#x201c;I think your mom is really starting to warm up to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Sally flips down the passenger-side sun visor and starts applying lipstick in the cosmetic mirror fixed to the back of it. <br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t mention my weight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Or my hairline.&#x201d; <br>Sally sighs. &#x201c;Why are you letting her get to you tonight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; <i>Yes I am.</i> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;m a doctor. Aren&#x2019;t mothers-in-law supposed to, you know, appreciate the doctor thing?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She does. It partly makes up for your not being Korean.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s done with the lipstick and is fluffing her black, shoulder-length hair. <br>I glance at her, chagrined. Such blunt, casual acknowledgment of the only ongoing source of tension in our marriage&#x2014;her parents&#x2019; displeasure with their daughter&#x2019;s decision to marry outside the Korean community, a displeasure that two well-adjusted grandchildren and years of stable marriage have done little to diminish&#x2014;is unusual. <br>&#x201c;But not completely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. And never will.&#x201d; She snaps the visor back into place and gazes out the window. &#x201c;But I think you know that already. Can we talk about something else?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; She must be in a philosophical mood or something. As bad as it&#x2019;s been for me with her parents, it&#x2019;s been ten times worse for her. But she&#x2019;s always stood her ground with them. It&#x2019;s one of the reasons I love her so much. <br>Sally is many different things, most of them synonyms for success, and all of which I absolutely adore: smart, driven, witty, confident. I know most people wouldn&#x2019;t call hers a pretty face&#x2014;on some objective level, from a purely aesthetic standpoint, I know it&#x2019;s quite plain, really; maybe even erring on the side of unattractive. Thick lips. A nose that&#x2019;s too small for her broad cheeks and wide-set eyes. But I can honestly say without a trace of sentimentality that I think she&#x2019;s absolutely beautiful. She has an indefinable charisma that belies her looks, an enviable, innate ability to walk into a crowded room, instinctually size it up, and win over every single person in it with smooth-talking charm. She doesn&#x2019;t even have to try. People like her. All kinds of people. To me, it&#x2019;s a mystical talent, something I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do if my life depended on it. And a talent that she&#x2019;s always put to good use: Before she had Katie and decided to stop working, Sally had a very successful career as a high-ranking assistant to the head of Human Resources at my hospital. That&#x2019;s how we met. <br>I try to think of something else to talk about, and my mind drifts back to the Styrofoam-peanut incident with Annabelle. I relate the story, playing down the part about me actually being out of the room when Katie shoved the packing material into her sister&#x2019;s mouth&#x2014;like a mother bear defending her cubs, Sally can be extremely touchy about anything that even remotely threatens the health of the girls, and my relatively more laissez-faire approach to parenting has gotten me into trouble with her more than once. But when I&#x2019;m finished, Sally simply throws back her head and laughs. &#x201c;&#x2018; <i>She liked my dinner.</i>&#x2019; You know, Katie reminds me more and more of you every day.&#x201d; <br>I think about the way Katie looked earlier tonight, bent over that stupid toy kitchen, so intent on what she was doing. &#x201c;Because she&#x2019;s so smart?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nice try. No. Because she&#x2019;s so stubborn.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I grip the steering wheel a bit more firmly. <br>Sally pats my shoulder affectionately. &#x201c;I know. You hate hearing that. But it is what it is. Besides, it&#x2019;s not all bad. Being single-minded is what&#x2019;s enabled you to succeed. I mean, you <i>never</i> give up. I love that about you. But it is a <i>real</i> pain in the ass sometimes. Once you&#x2019;ve made up your mind about something, no force on the planet will get you to change it. Even when you&#x2019;re wrong. <i>Especially</i> when you&#x2019;re wrong. You know what I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re seeing the same thing with Katie?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Every single day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Surgeons are pretty stubborn. Maybe she&#x2019;ll become a surgeon someday.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;God, I hope not.&#x201d; She smirks. <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Well&nbsp;&#x2026; you know what they say about surgeons, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Sometimes wrong, never unsure.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shit. Have I used that line before?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just a couple of hundred times. Where did you first hear it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly certain. Probably from Collier.&#x201d; <br>We ride together in silence for a few minutes before she says, &#x201c;Your meeting with Dr. Collier is next Monday. Right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What are the chances he&#x2019;s going to offer you a job?&#x201d; <br>My insides suddenly bunch up into a little ball. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Still? Haven&#x2019;t you talked to him about it yet?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We <i>really</i> need to stay here in Boston, Steve. Our whole lives are here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What do you want me to say?&#x201d; We&#x2019;re launching into a variation of a conversation we&#x2019;ve had countless times before. I <i>know</i> how much she wants to stay in Boston. &#x201c;The opportunity hasn&#x2019;t come up to talk about it. Besides, I think Northwest Hospital is getting ready to make a firm offer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But&nbsp;&#x2026; you don&#x2019;t want to work at Northwest.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The money&#x2019;s good at Northwest.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I said. It&#x2019;s not a medical school. It&#x2019;s not what you want.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How about Harvard, or U Mass?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not hiring right now.&#x201d; What&#x2019;s left unsaid is that there&#x2019;s only one job I really want anyway, more than I&#x2019;ve wanted just about anything else in my life, and Sally knows it: to work at University Hospital and be a professor at University Medical School. <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you ask Dr. Collier about it tonight? He&#x2019;ll be relaxed. Sociable.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m&nbsp;&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Since when are you so indecisive? You just got through saying how&#x201d;&#x2014;she lowers the pitch of her voice an octave&#x2014;&#x201c; <i>never unsure</i> you are.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t just go waltzing up to my boss and ask him for a job. It&#x2019;s not the way it works. We&#x2019;re talking about <i>University Hospital.</i> You don&#x2019;t <i>ask</i> to work at University. You&#x2019;re <i>invited.</i> Between med school and residency, I&#x2019;ve spent the last nine years of my life busting my ass there&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All the more reason for you to be proactive about the whole thing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t want to blow it now.&#x201d; <br>She drums her fingers along the armrest. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t ask him, how are you ever going to know for sure? Maybe he&#x2019;s waiting for you to show some interest.&#x201d; <br>I stare at the road and purse my lips. <br>&#x201c;Honestly.&#x201d; She sighs, turning back toward the window. &#x201c;Sometimes I don&#x2019;t know who&#x2019;s worse: you, or the five-year-old.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Dr. Collier and his wife stand in the spacious foyer of their home in Wellesley, underneath an elaborate chandelier, informally greeting their guests as they enter through the front door. It&#x2019;s been an unusually dry spring and summer, and the mosquito population is light, so the heavy oak front doors are thrown wide open to admit both a pleasant early-evening breeze and the guests streaming across the threshold. <br>Each year in July, Dr. Collier, the chairman of our department and my boss, has a cocktail party for all of the surgeons that work for him. He and his wife throw a pretty decent party. Beyond the foyer, in a living room with vaulted ceilings seemingly as high as a cathedral&#x2019;s, faculty and residents from my department stand around with drinks in their hands, clumped into groups of varying size and composition. They chat amiably as servers&#x2014;nubile young women wearing identical white dress shirts and long black pants&#x2014;circulate with blank smiles and hors d&#x2019;oeuvres laid out on silver platters. Along one side of the room, a string quartet plays classical music; on the opposite side, a bartender pours drinks from the Colliers&#x2019; ornate, marble-topped wet bar. <br>Dr. Collier himself is the spitting image of the actor Charlton Heston. Not the young, square-jawed, noble, 1950s Charlton Heston from the movie <i>The Ten Commandments</i>, but the older, crankier, more blustery 1960s and 1970s Charlton Heston from movies like <i>Planet of the Apes</i> and <i>The Omega Man</i> and <i>Soylent Green.</i> It&#x2019;s much more than just a passing resemblance, and I often wonder if Dr. Collier puts any conscious thought into imitating him. Tall, lanky, muscular, and uniformly bronzed even in the middle of January, his sinewy virility and biting cynicism are matched only by his propensity for spontaneously launching into bombastic speeches. <br>About the only non-Hestonesque thing about him is his musical preference in the operating room: show tunes. He&#x2019;s especially partial to <i>West Side Story.</i> Imagine watching Colonel Taylor from the original <i>Planet of the Apes</i> cut out somebody&#x2019;s kidney while humming along to &#x201c;I Feel Pretty,&#x201d; and you&#x2019;ll have some idea of what it&#x2019;s like to operate with Dr. Collier. <br>Tonight, he&#x2019;s wearing a light brown linen suit and pink dress shirt, no tie, with a pink paisley silk handkerchief neatly folded into the left breast pocket. <br>Sally and I approach Dr. and Mrs. Collier just as they&#x2019;re finishing speaking with one of the other residents. &#x201c;Steven,&#x201d; Dr. Collier says, shaking my hand briefly before focusing all of his attention on Sally. He smiles warmly and kisses her on the cheek. &#x201c;Good evening, Sally. Welcome to our home.&#x201d; <br>Mrs. Collier is a thin, graceful woman with long brown hair flecked with gray, friendly eyes, and a genteel Southern accent. Looking stylish in a sleeveless silver dress, she takes my hand first, then hugs Sally. Sally gushes over a console table that dominates the foyer (&#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t here last year, was it?&#x201d;). Mrs. Collier beams her approval and responds that no, she only bought it just last month, and launches into a detailed description of the antique store in which she discovered it. <br>Dr. Collier takes the opportunity to ...</p><h2>The Doctor&#39;s Wife (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>With <em>The Doctor's Wife</em>, Mary Elizabeth Braddon rewrote Flaubert's <em>Madame Bovary</em>, exploring the heroine's sense of entrapment and alienation in middle-class provincial life.

They are often conspicuous members of neotropical snake fauna, and are known for their irascible temperaments and, in some species, their highly variable color patterns. The Corallus hortulanus complex of treeboas comprises four species: 1)C. cookii on St. Vincent; 2)C. grenadensis on the Grenada Bank; 3)C. hortulanus in Amazonia, the Guianas, and Brazil&#39;s Atlantic forest; and 4)C. ruschenbergerii from southern Central America and northern South America. This book summarizes what is currently known about the natural history of each of the four species, with strong emphasis on C. grenadensis. Topics covered include color and pattern; habitat and habitat use; activity; food and foraging; predators and defensive behavior; populations; ecological relationships with other boids; and the connection between treeboas and humans. This hardcover book includes 27 graphs, 24 tables, 9 maps, and 9 black and white photos, plus 32 color photographs.</p><p></p><h2>Wolf of the Deep: Raphael Semmes and the Notorious Confederate Raider CSS Alabama</h2><p>The absorbing story of Raphael Semmes and the CSS<i> Alabama</i>, the Confederate raider that destroyed Union ocean shipping and took more prizes than any other raider in naval history.<br><br>In July 1862, the Confederate captain Raphael Semmes received orders to report to Liverpool, where he would take command of a secret new British-built steam warship.

He is the author of six previous books, including <i>Transatlantic</i>, a history of the great Atlantic steamships. He is based in Boston, Massachusetts.<b>Chapter One: The Captain and the Ship</b><br><br>Like most of the military heroes of the Civil War, Raphael Semmes burst into that sudden historical spotlight after an earlier career of no particular distinction. During thirty-five years in the Navy of the United States, he had often clashed with his superiors and railed at the clogged pipelines of promotion. He seemed distracted by intellectual and literary interests, or his second career as a lawyer, or the needs and pulls of his large family. Naval colleagues such as David Dixon Porter, more single-minded than Semmes, doubted his seriousness. &#x201c;While in the United States Navy, Semmes had little reputation as an officer,&#x201d; Porter recalled after the war.<br><br>"He was indolent and fond of his comfort, so that altogether his associates in the Navy gave him credit for very little energy. What was, then, the astonishment of his old companions to find that Semmes was pursuing a course that required the greatest skill and vigor; for there never was a naval commander who in so short a time committed such depredations on an enemy&#x2019;s commerce, or who so successfully eluded the vessels sent in pursuit of him."<br><br>Porter&#x2019;s later praise and criticism of Semmes were both filtered through the distorting passions of the opposite sides they had taken in the war. Porter was himself one of the many frustrated Union pursuers of the Confederate commander, and that public failure no doubt sharpened the edges of his dismissal of the prewar Semmes. Yet his final judgment of a former colleague who was so often underestimated seems balanced and well deserved. &#x201c;The inertness he had displayed while in the United States Navy had disappeared,&#x201d; Porter wrote of the captain who bestrode the deck of the <i>Alabama</i>. &#x201c;He had become a new man.&#x201d;<br>At the core of this transformation was Semmes&#x2019;s internal sense of himself as a Southerner&#x2014;evolving over many years, prodded along by events, and not finally firmed until after the start of the war. His Roman Catholic ancestors had for five generations lived in the border state of Maryland, a terrain contentiously split between its free-labor northern counties and slaveowning southern regions. In Charles County, twenty-five miles south of Washington, the Semmeses of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries grew tobacco and owned slaves. At times they attained wealth and prominence as members of the local Catholic gentry.<br><br>Raphael was born on September 27, 1809, at Effton Hills, Charles County, on the family&#x2019;s tobacco farm. His only brother, Samuel, was born two years later. Their mother, Catherine Middleton Semmes, died when the boys were young. Their father, Richard Thompson Semmes, then married again and moved the family into town, to the Georgetown district of Washington, where his brothers Alexander and Raphael were thriving in business. But Richard also died young, only thirty-nine years old, leaving no money and two sons who were just fourteen and twelve. The orphans, Raphael and Samuel, were very close, often sleeping in each other&#x2019;s arms.<br><br>Instead of being separated, they were delivered to the joint care of the families of Uncle Raphael and a third uncle, Benedict Joseph Semmes, a physician, farmer, and politician out in Piscataway, Prince George&#x2019;s County. Even before this formal arrangement, though, young Raphael had already learned important lessons from all his uncles. In the fluid country households of the time, children moved around and spent occasional seasons with their favorite relations. Raphael later remembered being &#x201c;reared on the banks of the Potomac,&#x201d; acquiring the swimming skills that, in future naval combats and disasters, would save his life more than once. Another relative, Joseph Semmes, ran the City Tavern near the corners of High and Bridge streets in Georgetown. More than just a drinking joint, it functioned as a major business, transportation, and cultural center&#x2014; and doubtless a fertile source of practical education for the curious young boy.<br><br>Uncle Benedict, an eminent graduate of the Baltimore Medical College with a statewide practice, taught his nephew the private joys and haven of serious reading. &#x201c;The habit of study is in itself a great comfort,&#x201d; Raphael later instructed one of his own children. &#x201c;I formed this habit myself in early life, under the wise counsels of your Uncle Ben, and it has been a great resource to me ever since.&#x201d; Though he may have spent a few years at a military academy in St. Mary&#x2019;s County, and once even offhandedly referred to &#x201c;the shreds and patches of our college learning,&#x201d; he was essentially self-educated: a lifelong, intent autodidact, never more at home than when lost in a book.<br><br>His uncles Alexander and Raphael inspired a naval career by giving the boy a taste for salt water and distant ports. Alexander owned a fleet of merchant ships sailing out of Georgetown, down the Potomac and on to the sea. Uncle Raphael&#x2019;s merchant shipping interests often took him across the Atlantic, then home with expansive stories to tell. Hanging around the ships and sailors, perhaps even venturing a quick coastal voyage, young Raphael decided to try life on the ocean. His main home, Uncle Raphael&#x2019;s crowded house in Georgetown, included five other children, with more to come. It seemed time to venture out on his own. In April 1826, with the necessary political help of his well-connected Uncle Ben, he was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy. The boy, not yet seventeen years old, was now a man.<br><br>Years before the founding of the Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1845, Semmes was entering a kind of apprenticeship for future naval officers. On a man-of-war, the midshipmen stood between the officers and the sailors&#x2014;hence the name&#x2014;taking orders from above and delivering them below. A tutor gave lessons in the arcane shipboard skills of navigation, astronomy, and artillery. The middies ate together, in messes of eight to twelve men, and slept together in the steerage. As a tight cluster of young men, they inevitably arranged themselves into a pecking order. Within this group, status depended on muscle and assertion. Raphael Semmes, small and bookish, lacked the usual credentials. It could not have been an easy initiation.<br><br>In confined circumstances at sea, with hundreds of rough men crowded into tight spaces for months at a time, often through severe and dangerous weather, survival depended on ruthless order and discipline. Every man and object claimed an assigned place. A typical Navy sailing ship of this period had four decks and three masts. (Steam power still lay in the future.) On the top deck, aft of the mainmast at the center of the vessel, the coveted quarterdeck was just for officers; midshipmen could not even set foot on its starboard side. Everyone, the captain included, had to touch his hat or cap upon entering the quarterdeck to acknowledge its significance. Toward the stern, aft of the mizzenmast, lay the raised poop deck. Ringed by bulwarks that held the sailors&#x2019; hammocks during the day, it also formed the roof of the captain&#x2019;s cabin.<br><br>The ship&#x2019;s clock hung over the door of this cabin. In an era when American life on shore was still gearing up to the industrial cadence of clock time, everyday shipboard routine moved to the precise, relentless ticking of that timepiece. The twenty-four hours were sliced into five watches of four hours each and two more&#x2014;the dog watches&#x2014;of two hours. Within each watch, the ship&#x2019;s bell was struck once after thirty minutes, twice after sixty, and so on. The constant question was not What time is it? but How many bells is it? At eight bells the watch changed and men shifted in synchronized patterns among their prescribed spots (below, above, and aloft), in the clockworked rhythms of working, sleeping, and eating.<br><br>The food and water were generally terrible. Water stored in large wooden casks smelled and tasted rank; it improved slightly when iron tanks replaced the casks. The daily staples of salt beef and rice were so blandly indigestible that they made occasional dishes of salt pork and bean soup seem like treats. The hard bread, veined by worms, was often rebaked until crisp; if this didn&#x2019;t improve the flavor, at least it killed the worms. The characteristic overpowering ship odor belowdecks&#x2014;of cooking, rotting food, cockroaches and vermin, and human waste, all mingling in a bracing stew of bilgewater&#x2014;did not improve appetites. A prolonged storm meant battened hatches and heavy, stifling air below, with all hands yearning for their first relieving gulps of the sweet oceanic atmosphere up on deck.<br><br>Yet Semmes, young and small as he was, found a place in these ships that felt comfortable and kept pulling him back. The basic social unit of shipboard life was the mess. For the middies, that meant about eight men in a small, low-ceilinged room, ten feet by ten feet, somewhere between decks. Each guy had a chest for his clothes. In the center of the room was a table for eating; off to one side, a small pantry for crockery and supplies. A lattice grating overhead let in some light and air, but the room was dark and poorly ventilated. The men were allowed only two candles a day and no open flames at night. They slept on the gun or berth decks, hanging their hammocks from hooks in the overhead beams. Like the members of an infantry unit, or harassed pledges of a college fraternity, the messmates drew together in their shared hardships and common needs&#x2014;and for lighter moments too. As young men away from home for the first time, exulting in their relative freedom, they all cracked jokes and pulled pranks, and kept each other loose.

Far more often than appreciated, these puppeteers orchestrate the interplay between predator and prey. With astonishing precision, parasites can coax rats to approach cats, spiders to transform the patterns of their webs, and fish to draw the attention of birds that then swoop down to feast on them. </p><p>We humans are hardly immune to the profound influence of parasites. Organisms we pick up from our own pets are strongly suspected of changing our personality traits and contributing to recklessness, impulsivity - even suicide. Microbes in our gut affect our emotions and the very wiring of our brains. Germs that cause colds and flu may alter our behavior even before symptoms become apparent. </p><p>Parasites influence our species on the cultural level, too. As McAuliffe documents, a subconscious fear of contagion impacts virtually every aspect of our lives, from our sexual attractions and social circles to our morals and political views. Drawing on a huge body of research, she argues that our dread of contamination is an evolved defense against parasites - and a double-edged sword. The horror and revulsion we feel when we come in contact with people who appear diseased or dirty helped pave the way for civilization but may also be the basis for major divisions in societies that persist to this day. </p><p>In the tradition of Jared Diamond's <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> and Neil Shubin's <i>Your Inner Fish</i>, <i>This Is Your Brain on Parasites</i> is both a journey into cutting-edge science and a revelatory examination of what it means to be human. </p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2016:</strong> Have you heard the one about the wasp that turns cockroaches into living food trucks for its larvae? How about the schizophrenia-inducing parasite that lives in your cat's litter box, literally altering human brain chemistry to its own inscrutable ends? If not, you have a choice to make: to immediately read or assiduously avoid Kathleen McAuliffe's <em>This Is Your Brain on Parasites: How Tiny Creatures Manipulate Our Behavior and Shape Society</em>. McAuliffe, author of <em>The Atlantic</em> article "How Your Cat Is Making You Crazy," surveys a horrorshow universe of microscopic maladies and the strangely specific ways they use us, including the shapes of our civilizations and beliefs.

While he achieved fame during his lifetime as an author, philosopher, alchemist and astronomer, composing a scientific treatise on the astrolabe for his ten year-old son Lewis, Chaucer also maintained an active career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat. Among his many works, which include The Book of the Duchess, the House of Fame, the Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde, he is best loved today for The Canterbury Tales. Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of the vernacular, Middle English, at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin.</p><h2>The Discovery of the Art of the Insane</h2><p><p>This pioneering work, the first history of the art of the insane, scrutinizes changes in attitudes toward the art of the mentally ill from a time when it was either ignored or ridiculed, through the era when major figures in the art world discovered the extraordinary power of visual statements by psychotic artists such as Adolf Wlfli and Richard Dadd. John MacGregor draws on his dual training in art history and in psychiatry and psychoanalysis to describe not only this evolution in attitudes but also the significant influence of the art of the mentally ill on the development of modern art as a whole. His detailed narrative, with its strangely beautiful illustrations, introduces us to a fascinating group of people that includes the psychotic artists, both trained and untrained, and the psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, critics, and art historians who encountered their work.</p></p><p>By tracing its change from a curiosity to an area of study for both creative artists and psychiatrists, MacGregor explores the art of the insane as a key to intellectual and cultural history from the 18th to the mid-20th centuries. The "discovery" of this art, says MacGregor, was made possible by the application of psychiatry's scientific methods to the realm of creativity. Careful documentation and preservation of work by psychopathic artists led to the recognition that their art, like the - correction: The publication date for Nan cy Chodorow's Feminism and Psychoana lytic Theory , reviewed in LJ 10/1/89, has been changed from November 1989 to Janu ary 1990. work of other artists, expresses a world view that cannot be separated from its social background. MacGregor also details the interest in and influence of psychopathic art on important 20th-century figures (e.g., Klee, Dali, Dubuffet). A difficult book, but recommended for academic libraries supporting interdisciplinary programs.<br><i>- Lucy Patrick, Florida State Univ .

Do you pick just one priority or try to put out every fire? How can you stay composed, figure out what really matters, and act decisively?&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>When former U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Brandon Webb transitioned to civilian life, he struggled to get his first startup business off the ground. He raised millions for his new venture, only to lose it all as problems spiraled out of his control.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the wake of that failure, Webb realized that successful entrepreneurs need a skill he had already mastered: total focus. SEAL snipers define it as the ability to filter out noise and chaos so you can make life-or-death decisions under the extreme conditions of combat. If he could maintain total focus while staring through crosshairs at a man who might (or might not) be an Al Qaeda terrorist, surely he could do the same in the business world.<br> &nbsp;<br> So Webb started over, applying total focus to a new startup, a media company called Hurricane Group. His approach was so effective that in just five years, Hurricane grew to have a staff of over fifty, an audience in the tens of millions, and a valuation of more than $100 million.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this book, Webb teaches us to make better decisions under extreme pressure by emulating the habits of his fellow warriors, as well as other skills he learned on the job and from great friends and business leaders like Solomon Choi of 16 Handles, Matt Meeker of BarkBox, and Betsy Morgan of the <i>Huffington Post</i> and TheBlaze. For instance, you&#x2019;ll discover:<br><br>� &nbsp;The difference between total focus and tunnel vision is developing total situational awareness: the ability to spot opportunities and threats without getting distracted from your goal.<br> � &nbsp;You can overcome indecisiveness and hesitancy by accepting violence of action: a decision to move forward with an imperfect plan, knowing that even the best-laid plans go wrong.<br> � &nbsp;Entrepreneurs must learn to embrace the suck, refusing to quit when the going gets brutal, and recognizing that unexpected challenges may reveal your best shot at success.<br><br>By following the tactics and wisdom of a generation of legendary snipers and business leaders, you&#x2019;ll find the clarity of mind you need to accomplish your own mission&#x2014;whatever it takes.</p><p><b>BRANDON WEBB</b> is the CEO of Hurricane Group, Inc. As a U.S. Navy chief and SEAL with more than a decade of service, he served multiple combat deployments to the Middle East and Afghanistan and was the head instructor at the Navy SEAL sniper school, which produced such students as Chris Kyle, Marcus Luttrell, and other legendary snipers.

Look, I want to hire you to teach me how to shoot. How soon can you get up to L.A.?"<br><br> This guy didn't waste any time getting down to business. Before I'd even had a chance to say hello, or "Yeah, Webb, that's me," he'd laid out his agenda. The man wasn't shy about saying what he wanted, and he expected to get it.<br><br> I never did find out exactly how he got my name, let alone my phone number. Not that I was hard to find. This was mid-2011; two years earlier, when the Captain Phillips rescue mission happened and suddenly everyone was talking about Navy SEAL snipers, I'd been invited onto CNN to talk about the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) sniper training program my friend Eric Davis and I had helped develop and run for a few years. Ever since, I'd been in the public eye as an expert in sniper instruction. It would have been no challenge at all for a resourceful guy like Todd to track me down.<br><br> I hated to disappoint him, but I was already working out how to say no.<br><br> Those years teaching the sniper course were incredibly satisfying, and I still loved going out shooting with friends now and then. But private instruction was just not something I did. Besides, I was too busy.<br><br> Insanely busy.<br><br> Crazy busy.<br><br> "I've been working on my long-gun form," Todd was saying. "I'm not terrible, but I could be a lot better. I'd just as soon learn from the best."<br><br> It didn't feel right to just say no outright, but I figured that if I threw out a ridiculously high number, he would go away.<br><br> "I charge five hundred dollars an hour," I said. "Also, I charge half that rate, two fifty an hour, for my travel time to and from." From San Diego to L.A., that would've meant at least another fifteen hundred tacked onto my fee. Add that to the three or four hours I'd probably spend with him, at five hundred a whack, and his private shooting lesson was looking like close to five grand. I figured he'd tell me to go screw myself.<br><br> "No problem," he said.<br><br> Oh, shit, I thought.<br><br> What could I say? The man called my bluff. That weekend I threw some guns in the car and made the drive up to L.A. to take Todd Dakarmen shooting.<br><br> We spent the whole day at the range. He could shoot, but he hadn't been trained in how to set up his scope properly. I see this all the time, guys who get into shooting but don't realize how important the initial setup of the rifle is. It's like fitting a good business suit to the individual. You don't buy an expensive suit off the rack, throw it on, and go walk into your meeting. Everyone's unique: different inseam, different chest size, and so forth. If you want to look the part, the thing needs to be tailored; that's the only way it becomes your suit. The same thing applies to a good rifle. You could just throw on a scope and go shoot, but you're not going to get the best results. Ideally, you need to get down there, put your shoulder into the buttstock, gauge your reach forward, see exactly where your cheek comes to rest, adjust the distance from your eye to the scope, and so on. Everything matters. To do it right, to fine-tune a rifle so it fits you like a fine Hugo Boss, typically takes about an hour.<br><br> Todd had brought five rifles with him. We took the time to dial in two of them. Then we started shooting, working on his fundamentals. We took a break for lunch and then went back to shoot some more. I ended up staying the weekend.<br><br> While I was there, Todd took me out to his plant, a huge facility in a big industrial park in East L.A. There were smashed-up vehicles on the floor and racks and racks of auto parts stacked up everywhere, all carefully inventoried-all taken from wrecked Porsches. Todd and his wife run a business called Los Angeles Dismantler. They'll find a wrecked Porsche Turbo, worth maybe a few hundred thousand brand new, pay ten grand or so to the insurance company that's written it off, then dismantle it and resell the parts to specialty stores and individuals for ten or fifteen times what they paid for the wreck. Talk about a business model.<br><br> The following weekend, I went up to L.A. to give Todd some more private classes. This time, as we were having lunch, he asked me what I was up to these days, and I told him about all the different things I had going.<br><br> I'd been out of the SEALs for five years at this point. My first year out, I'd done some contract security work over in a country I won't name (it rhymes with "Barack") for a government agency, but other than that I'd been a strictly private-sector entrepreneur. For most of those five years, I'd been working on a multimillion-dollar land development deal, a massive training facility and race car track out in the Southern California desert, called Wind Zero. I was also an active investor in Neptunic, the company that created the Sharksuit (metal mesh protective diving gear). I was doing a bunch of consulting. I was writing for a few military Web sites. I was also working on my memoir, The Red Circle.<br><br> I had a lot going on.<br><br> Todd didn't say a word as I ran down my list, just ate and listened. Finally, when I'd gotten to the end of a paragraph and paused to take a bite, he sat back and looked at me.<br><br> "You know, when I look at you, I see a lot of myself in you." I took that as a hell of a nice compliment and was about to say so, but he kept going. "You're kind of a mess, you think?"<br><br> Not what I was expecting him to say.<br><br> "I was doing like you're doing, not too long ago," he went on, "going in every direction at once. One day, a mentor sat me down and said, 'Todd, you need to collect yourself and focus on one thing. You're all over the map. As soon as you focus, things will start coming together. And you'll be successful.' I took his advice. He was dead right. Once I focused on this one opportunity, on Porsche parts, big things started happening."<br><br> He pushed back from the table.<br><br> "Anyway," he said as we got up to go shoot some more, "think about it."<br><br> I did. He was right; I was all over the place. I had twenty different irons in the fire. I wasn't focused. It was a recipe for disaster.<br><br> And disaster was exactly what I'd cooked up.<br><br> That land development project had blown up in my face. The county had approved it, and it had a lot of local support, but at the eleventh hour the thing had been nailed shut and screwed to the floor by a nuisance lawsuit by the Sierra Club. We'd spent millions our investors had put up to get this far. Fighting the suit would have cost millions more. I was trying everything I could think of to salvage it, in talks with another developer to take it over, but it was crushing me. My marriage was in trouble, too.<br><br> Todd was dead on target. I wasn't focused. And because I wasn't focused, nothing was really coming to fruition.<br><br> The thing was, I already knew this. Learning how to focus was a critical part of my training as a SEAL sniper, and SEAL training isn't like a weekend seminar. The things they teach you in the SEAL teams, they go bone deep, and they never leave you.<br><br> In the teams, we called it "front sight focus," and it was as critical to survival as breathing.<br><br> �Brandon!� Cassidy hisses in my ear. �You�re gonna have to Kentucky windage this thing!�<br><br> Lieutenant Cassidy and I and two other teammates are pinned like bugs to the scrubby Afghan mountainside; a knot of armed Taliban fighters are walking in our direction. They haven't found us yet, but they will any moment. If we leap to our feet and try to shoot it out, we're dead. Our only option is to call in an air strike and take these guys out with a bomb. Preferably without taking ourselves out at the same time. To call a strike with that degree of accuracy, someone needs to give the guys in the B-52 somewhere a mile or so above our heads the precise drop coordinates. That someone is me.<br><br> But because we weren't supposed to be out here in the first place, in this mission that was supposed to take eighteen hours but is lasting for days, I don't have my usual equipment with me: laser range finder, GPS, sniper scope, and the rest. All I have is my eyes, ears, brain, and gut.<br><br> As a sniper, I've been taught to estimate distances on the fly, but normally we're talking about shooting a bullet roughly the size of my forefinger from the muzzle of a rifle. Here I have to shoot a thousand-pound "bullet" out of a 125-ton aircraft, flying unseen somewhere over our heads at near the speed of sound, at a target less than five hundred yards away from where we are crouched. Without any range-finding equipment to help me aim the shot. In other words, I have to wing it, which is exactly what Cassidy means by "Kentucky windage." I have to get this right, and I have only seconds to do it. Sighting upward on an irregular rocky incline. In the deceptively vague light of daybreak.<br><br> Talk about an impossible decision under insane pressure.<br><br> Oh, great. Now the shooting starts. They've seen us. We're returning fire.<br><br> All right, class, let's review.<br><br> There are a bunch of guys shooting at us with intent to kill. We're in weird, crappy light, sighting uphill, with no sighting or range-finding equipment. I need to figure out exactly how far away these guys are so a plane somewhere up in the sky can drop a bomb on them and not hit us. And the guy in that B-52 is waiting for my numbers, now.<br><br> This is a situation that requires focus.<br><br> Focus. Yeah, I knew what Todd Dakarmen was talking about. Not only did I already know this; I had taught this. As a sniper, I had lived it. I just hadn�t been applying it to my life in business.<br><br> I would never make that mistake again.<br><br> The Single Most Important Principle<br><br> Front sight focus is that state of intense concentration in which all your resources and abilities are brought to bear on a singular intention, when you're so locked on to the crosshair reticle inside your scope (or, in an iron sights system, the sighting device at the front of your weapon, hence front sight focus) that everything else blurs and disappears. There may be helicopters overhead, gunfire in the streets, someone inches away screaming at you, but to you none of that exists. It may be raining or snowing, boiling or freezing. Hell, there may be snakes or scorpions slithering over your leg. Inconsequential. Irrelevant. Everything about your surroundings slips far away into the background, and you are completely calm and relaxed, focused on that solitary objective.<br><br> What makes this even harder is that you still have to know all that chaos going on around you. Some part of your brain has to stay acutely aware of it all. (That's the subject of chapter 2, "Total Situational Awareness.") You never fully let go of it, not for a millisecond. You've just trained yourself to tune it out and stay in total focus.<br><br> I call that central area of total focus my "red circle"-hence the title of my first book-and it's as critical to business as it is to Spec Ops warfare.<br><br> I talked recently with a friend who runs a graphic design business. "I have this great business idea," she told me. "We'd create this virtual concierge service for people visiting New York City who need anything-a good restaurant reservation, dry cleaning, a manicure, whatever. Start here and take it to other cities. I think the idea's killer," she added, "but I can't do it on my own. I need a partner."<br><br> Here we go again, I thought. Probably just what Todd Dakarmen thought that first day we talked. The truth is, hers wasn't a bad concept. It may even be a good one. I think there's something there. But is it something she should pursue? And if she does, what happens to the design business?<br><br> If you can't pour yourself 100 percent into an idea when you start it, then you're starting it half-assed, and you'll never have more than a half-baked plan. When you have a half-baked plan, you can't expect any more than a half-baked outcome.<br><br> By nature, most entrepreneurs have some form of attention deficit disorder. It can be an asset, that spark-and-shoot creativity, but unchecked, it can also be a serious liability. I run into younger entrepreneurs all the time who tell me, "Yeah, I've got three start-ups going," and I don't need to hear any more, because I already know how that story ends. You may think you're going to do three or four things at once and keep that up until one of them shows itself to be the winner-but you're kidding yourself. All you're doing is shortchanging all three or four projects. You need to choose one. Not two. One.<br><br> Which one? Of all the great projects you could be working on, which one most merits your undivided attention? There's no definitive, one-size-fits-all approach here, because every person and situation is unique. It may be the one that makes the most sense for your circumstances; the most marketable; the one that taps into your greatest skills; the one that most touches your imagination, quickens your pulse, stirs your soul; the one you've been talking about for the last ten years but never let yourself dive into; or even the one you're most afraid to try. Whatever it is, the best I can tell you is this: once you start asking the question, honestly and earnestly, you'll know the answer. It's that one.<br><br> If I had to pick a single core principle for success in business, it would be this: choose one thing, focus on that one thing, and execute it to the absolute limit of your abilities. Focus on your career, invest in yourself, and learn how to say no to everything else.</p><h2>Elizabeth I : The Exhibition Catalogue</h2><p>This lavishly illustrated book ties in with a major international exhibition opening at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich on 1 May 2003. Timed to commemorate the 400th anniversary since the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603, and sponsored by Morgan Stanley, the exhibition brings together a wealth of paintings, manuscripts, fine art objects and personal effects which illuminate Elizabeth&#39;s fascinating history. Elizabeth was born at Greenwich and spent her first months at Greenwich Palace, on the site of what is now a World Heritage Site, Maritime Greenwich. The book, containing contributions from a number of well-known experts on Tudor history, will focus on Elizabeth&#39;s Court as well as her relationship with the City of London and its increasingly influential mercantile class. It will also reflect the importance of Elizabeth&#39;s maritime adventurers, and their role in creating wealth for the crown, burgeoning maritime enterprise and the beginnings of an overseas empire.</p><p>Dr David Starkey is Bye fellow of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His biography of the young Elizabeth was Number One in the bestseller charts in both hardback and paperback, and is available in Vintage. He guest curated this exhibition; and he will write the chapter on princess Elizabeth. Susan Doran will edit the contributions and write the chapter on Elizabeth&#39;s suitors and the problem of the succession. Susan Doran is a lecturer at Christ Church College, Oxford and has written widely on the reign of Elizabeth and the 16th century in general. Her books include Monarchy and Matrimony: The Courtships of Elizabeth (1996) and a biography of Elizabeth in the British Library Historic Lives series to be published in 2003. Other contributors include Ian Archer, Patrick Collinson, Tarnya Cooper, Thomas M McCoog SJ, Sian Flynn and David Spence, Diana Scarisbrick, Nicola Watson and Michael Dobson.</p><h2>The Sixth Extinction: Patterns of Life and the Future of Humankind</h2><p><i>Richard Leakey, One Of The World's&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost Experts On Man's Evolutionary Past, Now Turns&nbsp;&nbsp;His Eye To The Future And Doesn't Like What He&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees</i>.<br><br> To the philosophical the&nbsp;&nbsp;earth is eternal, while the human race -- presumptive&nbsp;&nbsp;keeper of the world's history -- is a mere speck&nbsp;&nbsp;in the rich stream of life. It is known that&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing upon Earth is forever; geography, climate, and&nbsp;&nbsp;plant and animal life are all subject to radical&nbsp;&nbsp;change. On five occasions in the past, catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;natural events have caused mass extinctions on&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth. But today humans stand alone, in dubious&nbsp;&nbsp;distinction, among Earth's species: <i>Homo&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapiens</i> possesses the ability to destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;entire species at will, to trigger the sixth&nbsp;&nbsp;extinction in the history of life. In <i>The Sixth&nbsp;&nbsp;Extinction</i>, Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin&nbsp;&nbsp;consider how the grand sprawl of human life is&nbsp;&nbsp;inexorably wreaking havoc around the world. The&nbsp;&nbsp;authors of <i>Origins</i> and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Origins Reconsidered</i>, unimpeachable&nbsp;&nbsp;authorities on the human fossil record, turn their&nbsp;&nbsp;attention to the most uncharted anthropological territory&nbsp;&nbsp;of all: the future, and man's role in defining it.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Leakey and Lewin, man and his&nbsp;&nbsp;surrounding species are end products of history and&nbsp;&nbsp;chance. Now, however, humans have the unique&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity to recognize their influence on the global&nbsp;&nbsp;ecosystem, and consciously steer the outcome in order&nbsp;&nbsp;to avoid triggering an unimaginable upheaval.</p><p><b>Richard Leakey</b> is the world&#x2019;s most famous living paleoanthropologist. He resigned from his position as chairman of the National Museums of Kenya when&nbsp;Kenya&#x2019;s president, Daniel arap Moi appointed him to head the Kenya Wildlife Service.&nbsp;His parents were the archaeologists Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey. His half-brother is the leading plant scientist, Colin Leakey.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Roger Lewin</b>, <b>PhD,&nbsp;</b>is a biochemist, the former deputy editor of the British magazine&nbsp;<i>New Scientist</i>, and the author of <i>Making Waves: Irving Dardik and His Superwave Principle</i>, as well as many other highly praised books on biology such as <i>Complexity: Life at the Edge of Chaos</i> and <i>Patterns in Evolution: The New Molecular View</i>.Paleoanthropologist Leakey and coauthor Lewin (Origins Reconsidered, LJ 9/1/92) examine biology's traditional viewpoints, which maintain a linear progression from simple to complex species development. In this scenario, survival of the fittest means success, and species extinction indicates failure. The authors also present the current trends in evolutionary science theory suggesting that the world is shaped by mass extinctions (natural catastrophes have caused five) instead of natural selection and that the shape and behavior of biological communities is driven by chaotic interaction rather than the simplistic balance-of-nature concept. Leakey and Lewin argue that Homo sapiens is the result of many chance events in evolution rather than the foreordained culmination of evolutionary excellence. Unfortunately, our self-awareness and mental capacity has given us the dubious capability of triggering a sixth extinction, destroying entire species through overhunting and habitat destruction. As the only sentient creature among animals, we have the duty to protect all of Earth's species. The authors present a powerful message based on years of observation and fieldwork.

But all he wants to see is the world beyond the zoo. So whenever his keeper, Mr. Frumbee, leaves his cage open the tiniest bit, Wallace takes off on an adventure -- to the department store, the museum, or even the beach. So it&#39;s up to Mr. Frumbee -- with a little help from you -- to find that errant ape within the nine action-packed, full-color panoramas. (And while you&#39;re at it, Wallace has six friends who tag along on each of those adventures. Can you figure out who they are and find them in each spread? Here&#39;s a hint: Check out the totem pole in the Nature Museum.)</p><p>That wily Wallace! Where has he gone this time? The funny little orange-furred orangutan is always surrounded by friends at the zoo. But time after time Wallace's wanderlust drives him to escape from his comfortable day-to-day existence with his friend the zookeeper--to a department store, to the circus, to a baseball game, to the beach. The zookeeper is not as disturbed as you might imagine by Wallace's repeated breakouts. In fact, one might <i>almost</i> think he plants the ideas in Wallace's head himself... After all, every time Wallace disappears, it's up to the zookeeper to find him, even if that means spending an hour or two at an amusement park or the nature museum.<p> For over 35 years, readers of all ages have gleefully searched these pages for the mischievous ape. Hilary Knight, well-loved illustrator of the Eloise series, among many other picture books, created a classic with <i>Where's Wallace?</i>. Each of nine intricately detailed panoramic pictures is packed with lively, humorous activity, making the search for Wallace a delightful challenge. For those who pride themselves on having found the orange fellow on every spread, the book ups the ante. See if you can find the six additional characters accompanying Wallace on every adventure, including a cello player, a jogger, and an old woman who manages to keep knitting in the most unusual places!

Far from being forgotten, they have become a significant aspect of popular culture, prompting a continuing stream of books, feature films, television programs and board and computer games... there is a certain escapist satisfaction in looking back to an era when conflicts between entire states turned on clear-cut pitched battles between formed armies, lasting just a few hours and spanning just a few miles of ground. These battles were still unspeakably traumatic and grisly affairs for those involved &#x2014; at Cannae, Hannibal's men butchered around two and a half times as many Romans (out of a much smaller overall population) as there were British soldiers killed on the notorious first day of the Somme.</p><p>However, as with the great clashes of the Napoleonic era, time has dulled our preoccupation with such awful human consequences, and we tend to focus instead on the inspired generalship of commanders like Alexander and Caesar and on the intriguing tactical interactions of units such as massed pikemen and war elephants within the very different military context of pre-gunpowder warfare.</p></i><p><i>Lost Battles </i>takes a new and innovative approach to the battles of antiquity. Using his experience with conflict simulation, Philip Sabin draws together ancient evidence and modern scholarship to construct a generic, grand tactical model of the battles as a whole. This model unites a mathematical framework, to capture the movement and combat of the opposing armies, with human decisions to shape the tactics of the antagonists. Sabin then develops detailed scenarios for 36 individual battles such as Marathon and Cannae, and uses the comparative structure offered by the generic model to help cast light on which particular interpretations of the ancient sources on issues such as army size fit in best with the general patterns observed elsewhere. Readers can use the model to experiment for themselves by re-fighting engagements of their choice, tweaking the scenarios to accord with their own judgment of the evidence, trying out different tactics from those used historically, and seeing how the battle then plays out. <i>Lost Battles </i>thus offers a unique dynamic insight into ancient warfare, combining academic rigor with the interest and accessibility of simulation gaming. This book includes access to a downloadable computer simulation where the reader can view the author's simulations as well create their own.</p></p><p><p>Philip Sabin is Professor of Strategic Studies in the Department of War Studies at King's College, London.

One of Hitler&#x2019;s favorites, Wolff played an increasingly key role until he was appointed head of the German SS and police in 1943 in Italy, where he negotiated the secret surrender to Allen Dulles.</p><p>Jochen von Lang, born in 1925, a veteran journalist and historian, was the editor of Stern news magazine. His best known book is The Secretary, the only biography of Martin Bormann: The Man Who Manipulated Hitler. He is also known for an early report on Auschwitz death camp entitled &#34;Assassin Like You and Me?&#34;A German expert on the Third Reich gives us this dense but useful biography of one of Heinrich Himmler's right-hand men. A youthful veteran of WWI, Wolff was a bank officer and advertising agent during the '20s, but rose rapidly in the ranks of the SS after joining the Nazis in the early '30s. He spent much of his career as Himmler's chief of staff, and the author establishes his numerous connections to the Holocaust and dismisses his postwar claims of ignorance. Wolff was also something of a "fixer," arranging for a German racing driver to escape penalties for marrying a woman of Jewish ancestry and planning a gigantic castle to be the meeting place of the senior SS officers as a new order of Teutonic nights. In the second half of the war, Wolff participated in abortive negotiations with the Soviets for a separate peace, commanded the SS in Italy and was involved in plans to seize the pope. The author's extreme thoroughness makes the book primarily a scholarly resource, but it is also a worthwhile portrait of a criminal with complex motives. <i>(May) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The actual journal, Ben Israel - Odyssey of a modern Jew, recounts the breaking into consciousness and ultimate apprehension of an unsuspecting and resistant 'son of Israel.'</p></p><p>Art Katz attended Santa Monica City College, UCLA, and the University of California at Berkeley, earning B.A. and M.A. degrees in history as well as a M.A. degree in Theology at Luther Seminary, St. Paul, MN.

Intensity of attention to persons, intensity of application to business--and daring: these, one concludes from this and every other account, set Onassis apart and formed the basis of both his legend and his fortune. He had otherwise no accomplishments--no land-based investment as a monument, no innovation or masterstroke that was not a financial manipulation, temporal and transient. What Fraser and his fellow-researchers have done is to disprove some of Onassis&#39; claims and disclose additional details that, in some cases, make provisional judgments final. Thus, it appears from an unreleased report that &#34;&#34;the aileron controls had indeed been reversed&#34;&#34; on the plane whose crash ted to son Alexander&#39;s death. It also appears that the long post-mortem owes more to the authors&#39; possession of privileged information than to what it adds to an appreciation of Onassis&#39; grief. This is wall-to-wall journalism, as if everything said and done were still important, with the result that the aborted Omega-project negotiations take on the dimensions of a Constitutional Convention. The telling is toneless, mirthless, and virtually emotionless. About Jackie, one hears the same Onassis-originated innuendos that surfaced just before and after his death; she and her intimates haven&#39;t talked. But there&#39;s lots here, for the reader to make of it what the authors haven&#39;t.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Giant of Beringia: The Mystery of the Bering Land Bridge</h2><p>The intriguing theory of a land bridge periodically linking Siberia and Alaska during the coldest pulsations of the Ice Ages had been much debated since Jos� de Acosta, a Spanish missionary working in Mexico and Peru, first proposed the idea of a connection between the continents in 1589. But proof of the land bridge - now named Beringia after eighteenth-century Danish explorer Vitus Bering - eluded scientists until an inquiring geologist named Dave Hopkins emerged from rural New England and set himself to the task of solving the mystery. Through the life story of Hopkins, <i>The Last Giant of Beringia</i> reveals the fascinating science detective story that at last confirmed the existence of the land bridge that served as the intercontinental migration route for such massive Ice Age beasts as woolly mammoths, steppe bison, giant stag-moose, dire wolves, short-faced bears, and saber-toothed cats - and for the first humans to enter the New World from Asia. After proving unambiguously that the land bridge existed, Hopkins went on to show that the Beringian landscape cannot have been the "polar desert" that many had claimed, but provided forage enough to sustain a diverse menagerie of Ice Age behemoths.</p><p><b>Dan O'Neill</b> is the author of <i>A Land Gone Lonesome</i> and <i>The Last Giant of Beringia</i> . He was named Alaska Historian of the Year by the Alaska Historical Society for <i>The Firecracker Boys</i> . He lives in Fairbanks, Alaska.This is a short but compelling history of a major event in recent geological studies: the final proof in the early 1970s of the onetime existence of the Bering Land Bridge, a long-surmised strip of land that connected North America and Asia in the Ice Age, possibly as early as 14,000 years ago. Starting with the work of a Jesuit missionary in 1589, but focusing on natural historian Dave Hopkins, Alaskan historian O'Neill (<i>The Firecracker Boys</i>) gives an impressive presentation of the 400-year-old debate over Beringia, the name now commonly given to the land bridge over which early humans would have crossed eastward. But O'Neill is equally interested-perhaps more so-in paying tribute to Hopkins, the scientist whose pioneering archeological and geological studies defined Beringia as a distinctive area and ecosystem and who shaped the direction of modern Arctic studies. Starting with the influence of Hopkins's nature-loving New England mother, O'Neill charts what became a life of "searching for clues of ancient landscapes." He gives clear and compelling summaries of Hopkins's most important work, from his early discovery that deep spots in the Bering Strait were actually canyons and fragments of ancient river valleys, to his final landmark studies indicating that the ecological conditions of the land bridge would have been able to support herds of grazing animals, conditions that also would have permitted the land bridge to be inhabited by humans. This is an impressive portrait of Hopkins, a scientific "giant" whose legacy is as huge as the woolly mammoths that he showed to have ranged throughout Beringia. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whether it be fiction, reportage or essay, her work is marked by a truly extraordinary intellect and a luminous prose that is penetrating, precise, deft and, often, very funny. In this new collection-which includes the early and definitive profile of the National Guard; the widely discussed and still controversial review of Pauline Kael; and the first major piece about foreign contributions to American political campaigns-Adler's wide-ranging reflections become focused on two increasingly fused interests: the politics which govern our public world and the media, which now actively distort and misrepresent information about that world. <br><br>For anyone seriously interested in politics and the media <i>Canaries in the Mineshaft</i> is yet another proof that Renata Adler is one of the most delightful and brilliant writers of our day. <br></p><p>Renata Adler is the author of two novels, <i>Speedboat</i> and <i>Pitch Dark</i>, and four books of nonfiction: <i>A Year in the Dark</i>, <i>Toward a Radical Middle</i>, <i>Reckless Disregard</i> and <i>Gone: The Last Days of the New Yorker</i>.<br>PART 1SEARCHING FOR THE REAL NIXON SCANDAL: A LAST INFERENCEOn the weekend of Memorial Day 1976, at John Doar&#x2019;s farm near Millerton, New York, there was a reunion of what had been, in 1974, the House Judiciary Committee&#x2019;s impeachment inquiry staff. John Doar, who was Special Counsel for the inquiry, had since become a partner in a New York law firm, where he was in charge of a major antitrust case. Other members of the staff had returned for the occasion from their various jobs. Some had brought tents and sleeping bags. Others had rooms in the nearby motels and inns. A few were sleeping in the house. More than a hundred people in all showed up, also several dogs, including a small terrier called Credence and a huge English sheepdog, who had attended the original staff picnic, on August 15, 1974., in Washington. Thirty-nine former staff members had chartered a plane from Washington to Pittsburgh, where they were picked up by other former members of the staff. Supper, the first evening, was catered by the local Grange. People took motorcycle rides into the hills. Small bonfires were lit around the farm itself. Some of the youngest bounced on a trampoline or played basketball. From soon after supper until well after midnight, there was square dancing. A band and a caller had been brought in from Hartford. Nearly everyone took part in the square sets and in a virtually endless Virginia reel. In the wildest fantasies of San Clemente, no one could dream that such an event was taking place. And even in Millerton, one had the fleeting impression of dancing on a grave.It was not a grave, of course. President Nixon had only resigned. After nearly two years, it was no longer clear what that resignation had meant, or even what the inquiry had had to do with it. Meanwhile, with every document published by the Senate Select Committee on Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (the Church Committee), it was becoming more clear that the case for the impeachment of Richard Nixon, in 1974, had fallen apart.It all seemed, anyway, long ago, and difficult to remember in detail. In late July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Peter W. Rodino, had voted to recommend three Articles of Impeachment to the House. Article I was essentially an obstruction of justice charge. Article II charged misuse of the agencies of government. Article III, in effect, charged contempt of Congress, in doctoring and in refusing to produce subpoenaed evidence. In view of the Church Committee&#x2019;s account of the conduct of previous administrations, including violations of law and abuses of power since at least 1936, the first two Articles seemed to dissolve. As for Article III, there had been disagreement about it from the start. Doar himself ultimately did not support it&#x2014;on the grounds that requiring the President to produce this evidence, and thereby implicate himself in what would obviously become a highly serious criminal case, was reminiscent of the Star Chamber. Others argued that such a view implicitly endorsed claims of executive privilege, the national security, whatever, as camouflaged euphemisms for the Fifth Amendment; that if the President needed, in effect, to take the Fifth, he ought to be obliged, like any other citizen, to come right out and take it; and that a failure to pass Article III would add to all the other powers of the President a new power, to withhold evidence from the only process the Framers had established specifically to override such claims of secrecy: the impeachment process, the &#x201c;Grand Inquest of the Nation,&#x201d; by which the President could be held, constitutionally, to account.In any case, it didn&#x2019;t matter. Article III would never have passed, or even existed, without Articles I and II. The problem with all three Articles, and with their accompanying Summary of Information and Final Report, and with the thirty-odd volumes of Statements of Information, which were also published by the House Judiciary Committee, is that, in spite of a valid perception the whole country shared of the integrity of the process at the time, all those volumes never quite made their case, or any case. And one result, which nobody on the staff could possibly have foreseen, was that, in light of the Church Committee report and other documents, what remains of the records of the impeachment inquiry would support not only a claim that Richard Nixon was hounded from office after all, but also, more strangely, the reverse: that the impeachment inquiry itself was just another phase in the continuation of the cover-up.Neither of these claims, obviously, is right; yet they are not easy to dismiss. As there continue to be revelations of abuses of and by the CIA, the FBI, the IRS, the military, and officials at every level of government and corporate enterprise, in the remote as well as the immediate past, it becomes less and less clear why the Nixon presidency in particular had to end. This summer, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to establish a permanent Office of Special Prosecutor, as though what had seemed, in 1973, an extraordinary crisis, requiring extraordinary measures, was now perceived as a more or less permanent state of affairs in government&#x2014;and as though such a permanently critical situation could be remedied by the addition of yet another watchman to the constitutionally established existing watchmen in the night. Another indication of the degree to which the specific Nixon case remains still unresolved is implicit in those theories that Nixon was driven from office by a conspiracy within government itself&#x2014;more specifically, within the CIA. It is as though history already required, in explanation of Nixon&#x2019;s having left the presidency at all, an elaborate plot, in the form of a reconstruction from scraps of inconsistent evidence of an Agency cabal.It seems certain, though, that the Nixon presidency, far from being continuous with those before, was in fact unprecedented; that, without the supposition of cabals of any sort, Nixon himself did something not only more than any of his predecessors but altogether else. And the reason why no investigation, by Congress, or the press, or in the courts, has so far managed to establish precisely what he did has to do, I think, both with the way the investigations were conducted and with what I now believe to be the very nature of the case. Putting together some of the circumstances of the impeachment inquiry with a few facts in those Church Committee documents&#x2014;and trying to reconcile these with several, at the time apparently unaccountable, discrepancies and lapses in the conduct of President Nixon, his lawyers, and his aides&#x2014;I think one does arrive at a bottom line, a plausible, even obvious explanation of why it was that the Nixon presidency had to end. It may have been for a time unthinkable; or we may have known it all along.I. What Kind of Case?The inquiry. On the morning of March 27, 1974, Barbara Fletcher, who was in charge of most calls to the impeachment inquiry staff from congressmen and members of the press, received a long-distance call from a young man who claimed that in 1973, as he was walking down Wisconsin Avenue, President Nixon shot at him. For various reasons, few of the logs and records kept by the staff (and now sealed, for the foreseeable future, in the archives of the House Judiciary Committee) are altogether dependable or complete. The files of congressional committees are, in any case, notoriously inaccurate. But because of her diligence and the delicacy of her assignment in dealing with these calls, Miss Fletcher kept scrupulous and exhaustive logs. The young man said he had been wearing a shield. He asked to be given a lie detector test. He left two Milwaukee phone numbers, his mother&#x2019;s and his own. Miss Fletcher noted all this and said she would pass the information on. It was evident from the whole tone of the entry that the young man, like a lot of other callers&#x2014;like the lady who brought in her garbage as evidence that she was being poisoned; like the many hundreds of people who sent in rocks, with the message that only he who is without sin should cast them&#x2014;was not well.But among the innumerable what-ifs of the inquiry, and of Watergate itself, the problem might not have been a minor one. What if the young man had been completely sane and right? The staff would have been unable to investigate his claim. There were no investigators on the staff. And it is far from clear that shooting at a man in the street is contemplated in the phrase &#x201c;Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors&#x201d; &#x2014;the only grounds on which a President can be impeached. Shooting at a political opponent, certainly, would fall within the constitutional standard, as a &#x201c;political&#x201d; crime, that is, a crime against the system and the Constitution itself. But an ordinary violation of the criminal statutes, no matter how serious, is probably not contemplated in the phrase. The astonishingly foolish, poorly reasoned, and poorly documented brief submitted by the White House argued that it is: that &#x201c;other high Crimes and Misdemeanors&#x201d; simply meant a literal, ordinary (though in deference to that &#x201c;high,&#x201d; a serious) crime, committed in the President&#x2019;s &#x201c;public, or official capacity.&#x201d; It was hard to think of any unlawful acts, apart perhaps from adultery or purse-snatching, which a President might commit in his private, or unofficial capacity. The White House brief was intended, of course, to limit to the narrowest criminal terms any definition of the grounds on which a President might be impeached. It went on to say that &#x201c;high Crimes and Misdemeanors,&#x201d; as a term of art, had a unitary meaning, like &#x201c;bread and butter issues&#x201d;&#x2014;a comparison which, in its peculiar vulgarity, exemplified something both slipshod and condescending in the work of the White House lawyers, under James St. Clair, by whom the President was at the time so oddly, badly served. It was true of the whole brief what one of the youngest members of the inquiry said of subsequent documents submitted for the White House: that sooner or later, at their characteristic level of effectiveness, in general and in detail, these lawyers seemed bound to produce a brief on behalf of their client, President Philip N. Nixon.<br><br>One effect of the White House brief on grounds for impeachment, however, was to draw attention from the quality of the brief produced by the impeachment inquiry staff. That brief, our brief, which was published on February 20, 1974, was the first indication of what kind of work would be done by a staff of nearly forty lawyers who came from both political parties and from all parts of the country and who had, or claimed to have, by 1974, when they were hired, no view one way or another about whether President Nixon ought to be impeached. &#x201c;I will say that every staff member was questioned whether or not they had taken a position on impeachment,&#x201d; Special Counsel Doar told the Judiciary Committee on January 31, 1974, &#x201c;and if they had, other than that there should be an inquiry, then they were not considered for the job.&#x201d; For seven months, both Doar and Chairman Rodino insisted that no member of the staff take any side whatever on the question. As late as July 23, 1974, when Minority Counsel Sam Garrison suggested that Democrats on the staff might all along have been inclined to favor impeachment, while Republicans might have tended to oppose it, Rodino said that if he had known Garrison took such a view he would have fired him.While there were strong reasons for maintaining a bipartisan staff with this apparent viewlessness, in the first serious attempt to impeach a President in more than a century, the criterion is not one for putting together a firm of lawyers. It is more suited to selecting jurors&#x2014;who are meant unprofessionally to weigh, but never to investigate or to assemble a case. Lawyers are advocates. The lawyers Doar hired were bright, loyal, discreet, and highly recommended. They represented as broad a cross section of the country as the congressmen on the committee. They worked under two ironclad admonitions: to maintain absolute confidentiality and to be &#x201c;fair.&#x201d; At the same time, Doar had to proceed on the assumption that almost no one could be trusted. On January 2, 1974, I asked him how, in that case, he was going to keep perfect confidentiality in so large a staff of lawyers. &#x201c;You work them very hard,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and you don&#x2019;t tell them anything.&#x201d; The brief produced by such a staff was, predictably, deficient.So were most of the other inquiry documents. It turned out to be unimportant. What was important was that, through months of tension, crises of morale, and professional frustration, the staff did manage to work hard and to keep silent. What they were working on, or thought they were working on, is another matter. Few of them, at the time or even two years later, seemed to have more than an intimation that, while what they were doing was essential, the only thing essential about it was that they be seen to be doing <i>something</i> in secret, day and night, for months. &#x201c;Some of it was the worst time of my life,&#x201d; one of the junior lawyers said, more than a year after it was over. &#x201c;What you had for the first few months, you see, was thirty lawyers, treading water.&#x201d; That &#x201c;treading water&#x201d; was his insight. That &#x201c;for the first few months&#x201d; was an understatement. The fact that underlay the ordeal was that most of the work, almost all the time by almost all the staff, was a charade. A valuable charade, in that a machine was seen to churn, while no circus took place, and the courts, and a smaller group of Doar&#x2019;s, and ultimately the congressmen themselves could do their work. But the machine itself, firmly required to be directionless, produced, naturally enough, no investigation and, in the end, no case. It is commonly said that &#x201c;the case&#x201d; is in those thirty-odd staff volumes. Only by people who have not read them; hardly anyone has read them.Doar himself was working mainly with a smaller group of about seven people, five of whom were old friends who had worked with him before and who were not on the regular staff.1 Much of what could be salvaged from or written into the lamentable brief on grounds, for instance, was the work at the last minute of these ad hoc irregulars&#x2014;as was, for good or ill, the conduct of the inquiry, from the ordering of facts and strategies, through compiling the endless Statements of Information, Summary of Information, and Final Report, to the drafting of letters to the White House, of the actual Articles of Impeachment, and even of the statements of Chairman Rodino, from the opening of the inquiry, through the hearings, to the remarks with which he responded, in his living room, to the television broadcast of Richard Nixon&#x2019;s resignation speech.There was never any doubt among Doar and this small group that, unless there was overwhelming evidence of Nixon&#x2019;s innocence (and the only conceivable circumstance in which, by 1974, there could be such evidence would have been a conspiracy among his aides to frame him, in which case, under a superintendency theory, he might have been impeached for that), the object of the process was that the President must be impeached. Doar had, in fact, been the second nonradical person I knew, and the first Republican, to advocate impeachment&#x2014;months before he became Special Counsel, long before the inquiry began. There had to be such complete discretion on this point, and such constant, rote repetition of the words &#x201c;fair,&#x201d; &#x201c;fairness,&#x201d; &#x201c;fairly,&#x201d; that there arose a temperamental hazard of inventing pieties and believing in them, against the evidence of your own purposes and your own sense&#x2014;a hazard to which ...</p><h2>Karate: The Complete Kata</h2><p>The martial art of karate can be practiced by anyone, regardless of age or gender, and can be undertaken at any time during a person's life. Embraced by people the world over, this traditional Japanese art continues to hold universal appeal. Among the most important aspects of karate practice are the kata, patterns of movement that are carefully choreographed and arranged in sequences. <br><br>With <em>Karate: The Complete Kata</em>, Hirokazu Kanazawa, the foremost figure in the karate world today and a disciple of Gichin Funakoshi, the father of modern karate, offers the definitive work on the subject. Kanazawa explains all the key kata in great detail; and his text is accompanied by thousands of photographs. He also goes into some of the other more difficult aspects of karate, including steps, breathing techniques, and pressure points. Kata need to be practiced regularly on an individual basis, and this book is written with such training in mind. From the beginner to the most advanced practitioner, anyone interested in this revered martial art will want to add Kanazawa's book to his or her library. <br></p><p><br><strong>Hirokazu Kanazawa</strong> founded the Shotokan Karate-do International Federation of 1979.

Carmel, near Waco, Texas, examined from both sides - the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the FBI on one hand, and David Koresh and his followers on the other. Dick J. Reavis points out that the government had little reason to investigate Koresh and even less to raid the compound at Mt. Carmel. The government lied to the public about most of what happened - about who fired the first shots, about drug allegations, about child abuse. The FBI was duplicitous and negligent in gassing Mt. Carmel - and that alone could have started the fire that killed seventy-six people.<br>Drawing on interviews with survivors of Koresh's movement (which dates back to 1935, long before Koresh was born), on published accounts, on trial transcripts, on esoteric religious tracts and audiotapes that tell us who Koresh was and why people followed him, and most of all on secret documents that the government has not released to the public yet, Reavis has uncovered the real story from beginning to end, including the trial that followed.</p><p>DICK J.

Along the way he seduced a high-profile Midwest socialite into leaving her prominent industrialist husband, nearly died after being shot during a robbery, tricked both Christie&#x2019;s and Sotheby&#x2019;s into fencing stolen goods for him and was a fugitive for five years and the object of a nationwide manhunt.

In addition to things like escape routes and contingencies in case you trip an alarm, you have to decide what kinds of tools you&#x2019;re likely to need and what backup items make the most sense to drag along as well. I had a pretty good feel for what I was likely to be up against in the Hammer apartment, but I was also starting to come to grips with the fact that there was no choice but to navigate that sliver of a ledge and go in through a window. The door was just too risky. But with my back literally to the wall and the tips of my shoes sticking out over the edge, there wouldn&#x2019;t be any way to carry a whole load of tools with me. And if I ended up tripping an alarm before I even reached the unit, it would be tough enough moving quickly along that ledge without being further encumbered by a lot of weighty gear strapped to my body and not easily undone and dropped.<br><br>The answer, when it came to me, was so simple I kicked myself for not having thought of it sooner: I could carry all the tools I wanted up to the guest apartment and stash them there before I went out on the ledge. Once I was inside the Hammer place, all I had to do was go out their door and across the hall to the guest unit, pick up all my stuff and carry it right back.<br><br>All I really needed to have with me out on the ledge were some glass-cutting tools. If the Hammer patio door was locked and I suspected it was armed, I could cut a hole in it big enough to crawl through and then disable the alarm system from inside. This was in the days before ultrasonic motion detectors, so once I was in, there&#x2019;d be nothing further to trip.<br><br>Best of all, I wouldn&#x2019;t have to get back out on that hairy ledge to leave once I was done. I could just go down the stairs, same way I got up.<br><br>This was looking better and better. It further occurred to me that if I found I was missing a tool, I could simply leave the building altogether&#x2013;using the stairs and the grappling hook&#x2013;go get what I needed and come back. Again, no second outing on the ledge.<br>My escape route in case I somehow tripped a silent alarm in the guest apartment was looking good, too. I&#x2019;d have such a good view from that ledge I&#x2019;d be able to see flashing lights from miles away, with plenty of time to get inside and hide in almost any unoccupied unit with a cheap lock. By the time I was ready to do the job, I&#x2019;d identified three such apartments and knew how to open the doors on all of them. As long as I didn&#x2019;t have to cut through the glass in the patio door, there would be no trace of my having been in the building at all, and it would be treated as a false alarm. I could then come back after things had settled down and try a different tack.<br><br>The ideal time for a job like this would normally have been when the Hammers were planning to go to some fancy do, which I&#x2019;d be able to know in advance from the society pages. But that would probably be on a Friday or Saturday evening, and the beach area those afternoons would be teeming with people who could spot me easily. If I hit the place when they weren&#x2019;t in the process of getting ready for some event, though, there might not be anything worth stealing. It was certainly possible that they kept the baubles in a safety-deposit box and took out what Mrs. Hammer needed only when she needed it. So one time when I knew they were scheduled to attend a particularly fancy gala, I followed the Mrs. around for two days to see if she went to the bank, and she didn&#x2019;t. That told me they had a safe up there, and I included on my list of tools the stuff I&#x2019;d need to get into that.<br>More important, though, all that surveillance and analysis led me to a truly unpleasant conclusion: As if that ledge wouldn&#x2019;t be dangerous enough, I decided that this job needed to get done on a stormy night, when the beach would be deserted and there&#x2019;d be the sound of thunder and rain to drown out any noise I might make. It also had to be on a night when the Hammers weren&#x2019;t going to be at a posh soir�e, because I didn&#x2019;t want to go into that apartment on a night when Mrs. Hammer&#x2019;s best stuff was around her neck instead of in her safe.<br><br>Windy, wet and dark . . .<br><br>Over the next few days I started looking at the wisp of a ledge in a whole new light.<br><br>About two weeks later a perfectly timed storm roared in from the south. It began in the late afternoon of a weekday, and by the time I&#x2019;d grappled my way up to the stairs, stashed the hook and rope in a fire-extinguisher case and walked up to the fifteenth floor, it was coming down like a monsoon. I got into the guest unit without incident and did a quick look around to make sure I was really alone. I stayed busy and fast and wasted no movement, because I didn&#x2019;t want to dwell on what it would be like out on that ledge. I had planned this down to the tiniest detail, had even thought of carrying a washcloth to wipe the bottoms of my shoes so nobody could tell afterward how I&#x2019;d gotten in, and so now all that was left was to execute the plan, not give it any more thought. Front door closed but unlocked, bag of tools just inside of it, nothing sticking out of my jacket or pants to impede travel. That was the extent of my mental checklist, so I opened a window and put one leg through it, setting my foot down onto the ledge and sliding it around to test the traction.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t good. I&#x2019;d assumed the surface was of rough concrete and would have decent grip, but it was smoother than I&#x2019;d anticipated and the water from the rainstorm only made it worse. I&#x2019;d have to make sure to set each foot straight down with every step so as to rely as little as possible on friction to stop my forward motion, which is not the normal way of walking. I got my other leg through and then I was standing up on the outside of the building, still holding on to the bottom of the open window. I leaned back to slide it shut, in order to keep the rain out of the room, leaving a small gap to make sure I could get my fingers in to open it again. Not that it would have locked, but with no real purchase on that tiny ledge, I didn&#x2019;t want to be shoving upward on the glass itself trying to get it open. Finally, I let go completely and stood up again, then started moving.<br><br>I&#x2019;d envisioned the whole trip with my back to the wall, but after about ten feet of futilely wiping rain from my eyes and imagining my feet sliding out from under me in a heel-to-toe direction, I turned around and hugged the wall instead. I wiggled my feet slightly with each step, feeling for any changes in traction, and the way my shoes were sliding on that slick surface started up a sickening feeling in my belly. I wondered what the police would make of a body squashed on the concrete far below if I slipped. A suicide, perhaps?<br>It was a truly horrific goddamned trip. I&#x2019;d already done some high-wire heists, like at the ultra-ritzy Fountainhead, but that was a cakewalk compared to this. That had been a vertical climb, and I&#x2019;d had a nice comfortable rope to hang on to with both hands, could even wrap my legs around it if I needed a rest, and at worst would have had a forty-foot drop to some sand and a broken leg or two if it all went to shit.<br><br>But this . . . this was insane. One sneeze and I could be over the edge. I hadn&#x2019;t fully appreciated before this how reassuring it was to have something&#x2013;anything&#x2013;to grab on to. All I had here were my hands flat along the wall, and every gust of wind that whipped at my back was like a malevolent force trying to tear me off the building and fling me into the void.<br><br>Maybe you were expecting some bullshit about how I stared imminent death in the face and forced it to keep its distance. Well, forget it. I was scared shitless. I was always afraid on scores. Not to be would have been lunacy, and this was the most lunatic situation I&#x2019;d ever launched myself into. On top of all the inherent physical danger was the fact that I was engaged in a criminal activity, so at the same time that I was trying not to die, I was also trying not to be seen. The trick was not to be afraid of being afraid, because fear was a healthy thing in this game, and what you were really after was balance: Be afraid enough to keep you on your toes but not so much that it compromises the execution of the plan. If you&#x2019;re going to let fear get in the way, this is the wrong business to be in.<br>Stepping onto the Hammer balcony was such a relief, I just sat there and gulped air for a minute, gripping the railing so hard I wasn&#x2019;t sure I&#x2019;d ever be able to uncurl my fingers from it. When I finally did, I found that the patio door was unlocked and there were no sensors anywhere to be seen. That bit of good fortune should have had a calming effect on me, but my mind was racing nevertheless. This was going almost too smoothly, notwithstanding the nightmare trip along the ledge. I started to wonder if I&#x2019;d really thought of everything, but I drove that out of my head immediately. It wasn&#x2019;t too likely I was going to think of anything useful while in the thick of things that I hadn&#x2019;t already considered during weeks of careful planning.<br><br>I stepped into the apartment and just listened for a while, then did a thorough search to make sure I was absolutely alone. It was dark, but I didn&#x2019;t want to turn on any lights, so I used my penlight. Last stop was the bedroom, and what do you know: There was a large jewelry box right on top of the dresser. The lid was flipped open and the top section was nearly overflowing with fabulous stuff. Santa Claus never had it this good, and he was only after cookies.<br><br>This moment, right here, was why I was a jewel thief.

Court records, wiretap transcripts, facsimiles of seemingly any article that mentions her and incident reports from her two-year prison stint: by rifling through her past as one of America's oddball pseudo-celebrities, Fleiss attempts, as she asserts in a brief introduction, to create a book about "memory, style, culture, and politics, as much as anything else." The copious news clippings are intended to "provide the context, so that the truth of those times can live on," and there's a revealing fascination on Fleiss's part with the endless coverage about her. But the most intriguing documents are the ones that weren't public until this book's release-images and descriptions of Fleiss's fellow inmates, the tug of war Fleiss enacted with prison officials in order to be transferred to a federal boot camp program so she could get out of prison more quickly, the overcrowded halfway house she entered after prison. Fleiss also includes plenty of unrevealing musings ("they say there is nothing like a woman scorned...well nothing compares to the ego of a man"), justifications and recriminations (one section of the book is titled "Jealous and Angry Hookers") in a hodgepodge of commentary that's complemented by the book's cluttered design. With its promise of tell-all titillation, curious celeb-hounds won't be deterred by this media scrapbook's shortcomings. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Martin Heidegger</h2><p>With characteristic lucidity and style, Steiner makes Heidegger's immensely difficult body of work accessible to the general reader.

The addressee fingered the dried ink before turning the envelope and noting the wax seal. A bold M circled by what appeared to be holly.</p> <p>Interesting, Georgiana thought.</p> <p>Not too long ago, the concept of receiving what was undoubtedly an invitation addressed directly to her by people unknown would have flabbergasted her. Half a year of traveling through Europe had altered her expectations and such invitations were so common an occurrence that she barely noted the absurdity of it. Furthermore, she was actually rather surprised that this was the first as yet conveyed since she had arrived in Lyon three days ago.</p> <p>Her smile deepened, a low chuckle escaping as she shook her head. How Fitzwilliam would laugh at me, she mused, the thought rising unbidden and causing a sharp pang that pierced her heart. The smile faded, but she rapidly smothered her homesickness, walking to the wide, cushioned seat recessed into the window alcove where the stunning view would lift her spirits. She sat, taking a moment to gaze over the perfectly symmetrical rows of grapevines that stretched in an unbroken sweep to the distant river. All were barren of growth and she fleetingly wished it were spring or summer rather than deep winter, but then she squelched that ridiculous notion, thankful that her excursion abroad would encompass all four seasons ere her return to England in April.</p> <p>Yes, I am a little homesick. Her smile returned as her attention was given to the missive held in her hand.</p> <p>The Marquis and Douairi�re-Marquise de Marcov request the presence of Miss Georgiana Darcy for d�ner de gala at the Ch�teau la Rochebelin on 21 January of 1820 at hour seven.</p> <p>As she suspected, the de Marcovs were unknown to her. She shrugged, certain that her aunt and uncle would be familiar with the family. She was under their jurisdiction for this leg of the journey and trusted them explicitly. Thus far, there had been no cause for doubt or dismay, every partaken entertainment delightful. She rested her head against the cold wall, her thick plaited coil of golden hair acting as a cushion. Her reflection shimmered on the polished surface of the glass, her densely lashed large eyes so vividly blue that they mocked the dull sky of winter. Not the tiniest wrinkle of unhappiness marred the smooth perfection of her high forehead, honeyed brows arching delicately over round eyes that surveyed the landscape stretching before her. The chilled air infused rosiness in her cheeks, the only hint of color on her creamy skin, and she drew the wrap closer about her arms.</p> <p>The Ch�teau Plessis-Rh�ne, home of the Vicomte de Valday, sat on a gentle rise surrounded by fertile fields. Even in the winter the countryside was verdant with enormous evergreen trees and bushes randomly distributed amongst the dormant vines, leafless trees, and dulled lawns. The waters of the Sa�ne glittered turquoise in the muted daylight of what was a typically sullen day, the residuals of misty fog lingering in places. The intermittent rain from the day before continued to threaten, lurking darkly in the patchy clouds that obscured the sun. Georgiana much preferred the warmth and brightness of a summer day, but the play of grays and shadows amid the nimbostratus clouds mixing with the colors on the ground was beautiful in its own way.</p> <p>Sunshine or gloom, the joy of being stationary and surrounded by stout walls was priceless.</p> <p>Georgiana had discovered during the Channel crossing from England the previous spring that sea voyages did not disturb her as they did her unfortunate brother. Therefore, as difficult as it was to say arrivederci to Italy, she had relished the complication-free voyage across the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, the inclement weather that had not plagued them during the voyage had beset them once on terra firma. Crossing the Alps of Switzerland last June was as easy as a country stroll compared to the rigors of the overland journey from Genoa to Lyon. Incessant rains and wind-blown debris required frequent halts and accommodations in less than luxurious coaching inns. The cold was unrelenting, their sturdy carriage and piles of blankets and furs seemingly worthless against the chill. The bedraggled travelers arrived at the massive estate owned by the de Valdays, never before experiencing such joy to see a house!</p> <p>Simply being warm and clean had lifted Georgiana's sagging spirits immeasurably. Now if she could only ease the ache in her heart.</p> <p>Georgiana sighed, gazing at the cloud formations suspiciously. A sudden flurry of activity to the right captured her attention and brought a laugh to her lips. A dozen birds had burst forth from a copse of low bushes with dead leaves flying crazily, the agitating predator unseen but the squawks indicative of some sort of fright. It was a simple thing, of course, and nothing she may not have witnessed at Pemberley, but the landscape was so unique and served to remind her of how fortunate she was&#x2015;and how amazing the journey was, in spite of the pangs of homesickness and grief.</p> <p>A clamor in French from the hallway broke her reverie, seconds later the door bursting open and three figures tumbling into the parlor.</p> <p>"Dearest Georgiana, finally! Hiding away already, are you? Fr�d�ric insisted that we hunt you down and rescue from your solitary daydreams!"</p> <p>The speaker was a young woman of nineteen. She was short, barely reaching Georgiana's shoulders, with a voluptuous figure finely accentuated by an exquisitely tailored gown of purple velvet. Her lavender-tinted eyes blazed vibrantly amid a round face. Mischief and impertinence were etched upon her entire countenance from the tiny tapping foot to the mass of tightly coiled ebony curls audaciously escaping jeweled pins. She was in all ways a vision of supreme, sensual loveliness that could wrest the breath away from everyone who beheld her, male or female. Her name was Zo�, and her lush beauty was so ineffable that it was impossible to imagine that another could match it.</p> <p>Yet the woman standing near her was indeed a match.</p> <p>Her twin, Yvette, was nearly a duplicate. It was only the small mole located just to the right of her upper lip that easily revealed her unique identity. The combined essence of these two extraordinary creatures was a captivating assault upon one's senses. The blessing from the Maker in allowing the creation of two entrancing offspring would presumably then exhaust any hope of further divine favor upon their parents, but this was not the case.</p> <p>Fr�d�ric, nearly eighteen, was as stunning and forceful a presence as his elder sisters. With his curls styled foppishly about his face, his enormous deep-blue eyes, and his plump mouth, he had a slight feminine air to his look that was aided by his shorter stature and stout fleshiness. But this was only at first glance. As soon as he moved or spoke a word, the effeminate vision was swept away by a personality, voice, and bearing that exuded confident masculinity. The three de Valdays were bewitching and somewhat exhausting, but Georgiana adored them already.</p> <p>Fr�d�ric bowed gallantly, spearing Georgiana with an unconsciously sensuous gaze. "Rescuing damsels is a gentleman's sworn duty, is it not, beautiful lady? Especially she who is fated to be one's love for all eternity?"</p> <p>Georgiana laughed, shaking her head as he kissed her hand.</p> <p>"Foolish child!" Yvette declared, shoving her brother aside. "How many women have you declared undying, passionate love to this week?" Fr�d�ric merely shrugged, his grin brilliant and unrepentant. Yvette sniffed, turning to Georgiana and opening her mouth to speak, but Zo� beat her to it.</p> <p>"I see you have your own invitation to the de Marcov's gala. Magnifique!" She fluttered the parchment paper addressed to her in the air while performing a sequence of graceful pirouettes about the room, gleefully singing, "Dancing, dancing, dancing! Until dawn! With endless parades of handsome men!"</p> <p>"Shall you save one dance for me, sweet sister?"</p> <p>"I said &#x2018;handsome men,' dear brother, not &#x2018;homely child.'" She continued to dance about the room, Fr�d�ric laughing and fluidly twirling toward her, engaging in an elegant pas de deux.</p> <p>Yvette sat onto the window seat beside Georgiana. She held her invitation in her hand, face alit with the same sparkling joy as her sister's. "Is it not marvelous? You shall meet dozens upon dozens of men, the finest noble gentilshommes of the Rh�ne-Alpes. Perhaps you shall fall madly in love and never wish to return home!"</p> <p>"That is doubtful, my dear Yvette."</p> <p>"I shall not give up hope, my friend! Why return to dreary England?"</p> <p>Georgiana laughed. "You have never been there, and should be hesitant to call any other place dreary considering the weather here."</p> <p>Yvette shrugged and then suddenly gasped, eyes wide as she grasped Georgiana's hand. "They say the grand ball is in honor of Lord de Marcov's betrothed, an Englishwoman! Perhaps you know her!"</p> <p>"Highly unlikely. Dreary England is a vast continent. Do you know all in France?"</p> <p>Yvette laughed gaily, deep dimples flashing, rising to commence her own sweeping ballet across the room. "Not as yet, but someday I shall. Famous I will be! An actress or prima ballerina or wife to the greatest duke in the Empire!"</p> <p>"Come, Georgiana! Practice the dance with us!" Zo� dragged her from the window seat, Georgiana blushing and shaking her head, but swiftly getting caught up in the frivolity of the moment. One could never maintain a dour attitude for long when surrounded by the de Valday siblings.</p> <p>"I deduce the invitations have been delivered."</p> <p>The gay voice, accented English in a melodious tone, interrupted Georgiana's silliness. Her cheeks flushed in embarrassment but the three de Valdays continued to twirl.</p> <p>"Yes, mother dearest! Dancing and flirting and dancing!"</p> <p>"Will there be handsome Englishmen, Mama? Men with exotic accents and clear blue eyes like Georgiana?"</p> <p>"Not every man in England has blue eyes," Georgiana explained with a laugh, but the girls ignored her.</p> <p>"With luck the mysterious Englishwoman will have a dozen sisters for Fr�d�ric to flirt and fall in love with."</p> <p>Fr�d�ric grinned at Yvette, but declared emphatically, "My heart has been lost to the glorious Miss Darcy and I shall never gaze upon another!"</p> <p>The Vicomtesse de Valday waved her hand airily, winking at Lady Matlock as the two of them entered the room and crossed to the sofa. "Of course, Fr�d�ric," his mother said with exaggerated conviction, sitting onto the cushion before answering her daughters. "I do not know if there shall be dozens of English men or women for you three to charm. Nevertheless, I am sure there shall be dozens and dozens of eligible French dance partners, since the de Marcovs never celebrate by halves."</p> <p>"Pish!" Yvette pouted, lower lip protruding becomingly. "We have charmed all the available men in Lyon. None are remotely interesting, are they, Zo�?" Her twin nodded, curls bobbing and pout as adorable. "We must travel to Paris or Vienna or London for fresh conquests."</p> <p>Zo� fell in a graceful heap at her mother's feet. "Oh yes, Mama. Lyon is so dreadfully dull! Surely you saw hundreds of gorgeous Englishmen when you lived in England?"</p> <p>"Perhaps," Lady de Valday responded with a secretive smile, "but if you remember, silly girl, I met your father while dwelling in England, at Lady Matlock's home, in fact, so other handsome men vanished from my memories."</p> <p>"Oh yes!" Yvette joined her sister in a pool of skirts at their mother's feet. "Tell us the story of how you and Papa met and fell so desperately in love!"</p> <p>"Oh so romantic!" Zo� added with a dramatic clutch to her heart and a feigned swoon.</p> <p>The vicomtesse laughed and shook her head. "You have heard the tale a million times and yet still add your own flourishes to a mundane meeting. Silly girls!"</p> <p>The chorus of pleases rose to the gilded ceiling, but it was Georgiana's softly spoken reminder that she had not heard the story that prompted the two older women to jointly recount how they first met.</p> <p>"It was in the years prior to the Revolution," Lady de Valday began, her voice serious and sad. "My father was a loyal royalist and refused to leave as the Terror grew. It would prove to be an unwise choice, as there was no halting the blood thirst of the masses and his efforts to spread rationality only earned him an appointment with the guillotine."</p> <p>She paused, wiping a tear from her eye before able to put aside the endless grief. "He was not, however, completely foolish or trusting. He secured our wealth, secreting the bulk of our family heirlooms, and then he sent us away to England. My mother cried and refused to leave him, but he insisted. It saved us all."</p> <p>Her voice broke, the memories still raw. Lady Matlock squeezed her friend's hand and took up the tale. "I was a young wife then, living at Rivallain with my husband, and we opened our home to French refugees. In�s and her family came to us, her mother and mine related distantly. They dwelt with us for nearly four years, and In�s and I grew close."</p> <p>She smiled affectionately at Lady de Valday, who smiled back as long ago memories washed over them. "It was a wonderful experience," Lady Matlock resumed, gazing at her friend. "I perfected my French, learned many new musical techniques and compositions as well as artistic talents, since In�s is brilliantly accomplished. We became dearest friends."</p> <p>"What Madeline does not say is that she is an incredible painter who could never teach me to hold a brush the correct way, let alone actually create an image of worth, and that she soundly beat me at every sport we engaged in! Her archery skills are incomparable."</p> <p>"I shall concede the truth of that, although we were equal equestrians and a generous portion of our days were spent exploring on horseback. But of course the most memorable time was when C�saire, your father, came with his family."</p> <p>In�s blushed, much like an adolescent with her first crush, and took up the narrative. "He was so handsome. He still is, of course, but then? Ah, magnifique! His grandfather knew the previous Lord Matlock; I cannot quite recollect how the connection originated, but it did not matter. My heart was instantly captivated."</p> <p>"And Papa? Was he as captivated?" Yvette asked breathlessly, as if she had never heard the story.</p> <p>"Alas, no. He was intrigued, but far too capricious to willingly settle based on a summer acquaintance."</p> <p>"But you were persistent, oui, Mama?"</p> <p>"A huntress determined to capture the man of your dreams! Your will firmly set to acquire what your heart needed to survive!"</p> <p>Lady de Valday laughed at her girls' exclamations, shaking her head as she replied, "To a point, I suppose. We females can be quite tenacious. But in truth, it was our parents who finagled matters. Unbeknownst to us, they agreed the match was to be. All your father and I knew was that once the war ended, with Napoleon restoring a semblance of order so we could return to France, our ...</p></p><h2>Starting a New Church</h2><p>Rising generations of Americans are ignorant of Jesus Christ and have virtually no moral absolutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So who will evangelize them and whats the best way to go about it?

What if that single day began a healing, cleansing, revitalizing process, raising your awareness of the poisons that pollute our environment and purging your body of the toxins that set you up for weight gain, fatigue, and a host of deadly, debilitating diseases?<br><br>Well, that single day is here. It's called the Fast Track One-Day Detox Diet. It's safe. It feels terrific. And it works.<br><b>A One-Day Miracle Diet:<br>Too Good to Be True?</b><br>Who doesn't like quick fixes and magic bullets? They're the reason that weight-loss products promising instant results have become a multibillion-dollar industry that's growing every year. The fact that most of these trendy diets don't work, don't last, and often put us at risk for serious health problems seems less important to many desperate dieters than the glittering promises these plans make.<br><br>As a nutritional maverick, I have always bucked the system Yet for more than twenty years, even I believed that there's no such thing as a magic bullet&#x2014;although my internationally best-selling Fat Flush Plan has certainly come close! Throughout my hands-on experience with thousands of patients and clients in the public health arena (including a stint as the chief nutritionist for the pediatric clinic at New York City's Bellevue Hospital) and in the private sector (several years as the director of nutrition at the Pritikin Longevity Center in Santa Monica, California), I've always advocated long-term lifestyle changes, avoiding the one-shot answers that seem so popular in the weight-loss world. Although many diet gurus preached the gospel of exercising more and eating less, of cutting out fats, or&#x2014;more recently&#x2014;of eliminating carbs, I've always understood that our bodies and metabolisms are too complex for such simple solutions.<br><br>When I introduced my two-week program in <i>Beyond Pritikin</i> nearly two decades ago and then brought out a more extensive version of that diet in <i>The Fat Flush Plan</i>, I helped revolutionize weight loss by introducing the concept of detox to the diet world. Years before Atkins, South Beach, and the Zone, I predicted that the low-fat, high-carb diets so popular in the 1980s were actually creating weight gain, sugar cravings, fatigue, and diabetes&#x2014;health concerns that have taken on epidemic proportions today. I was the first to point out the importance of the essential fatty acids for weight loss as well as for overall health and beauty, a recurring theme in my two dozen books. My millions of readers around the world, and the millions more who visit my Web site (www.fasttrackdetox.com), have always known that they can count on me for sound, well-researched nutritional advice based on both real-life experience and scientific evidence.<br><br>Then, in November 2003, <i>Woman's World</i> magazine came to me with an unusual request. They wanted a one-day juice fast, the recipe for a special brew that would enable readers to quickly lose 3 to 5 pounds so they could fit into that special outfit or take off that holiday weight.<br><br>A fast can be a terrific weight-loss method because during a fast, the primary source of fuel for the cells is fat. Of course, I'd known for years that an improperly done fast can actually sabotage weight loss by disrupting your metabolism. The wrong kind of fasting can also threaten your health by stressing your liver, clogging your colon, and flooding your bloodstream with the oil-soluble toxins that your body had been storing in its fat.<br><br>On the other hand, a fast done right&#x2014;with your body prepared for fasting and properly supported during the regime&#x2014;can flush the accumulated toxins from your cells, accelerate your weight loss, cleanse your body, and combat the effects of aging. Periodic fasting of this type can clear up skin conditions, boost your energy, and put a sparkle in your eyes.<br><br>Moreover, a properly done fast offers you a chance to detoxify your body. A body overloaded with toxins and pollutants suffers from a weakened immune system, a stressed-out liver, and, in all probability, a malfunctioning colon. Such "toxic" bodies are far more vulnerable to disorders great and small, ranging from colds, flu, and fatigue to arthritis, asthma, and allergies--all the way up to autoimmune conditions, heart disease, and cancer. In other words, <i>properly done fasting is the missing link to better health</i>.<br><br>And fasting and detox have one more benefit, perhaps the most dramatic and the least well-known of all. <i>Fasting is the missing link to long-term weight loss</i>. That's because detox and weight loss go hand in hand. So the more toxic your body becomes, the more difficulty you will have losing weight and keeping it off.<br><b>Weight Loss and Toxicity:<br>The Missing Link</b><br>The connection between weight loss and toxicity is so important, I'll say it again: <i>The more toxic your body becomes, the more difficulty you'll have losing weight</i>. Does that sound like an extreme statement? Then consider for a moment the "obesity epidemic" that you've no doubt read about. We now know that more than sixty diseases have been linked to obesity. More than 80 percent of Americans are overweight, while at least 30 percent of U.S. adults are obese&#x2014;and close to 20 million children. Think of it&#x2014;a whopping eight out of ten Americans face a weight gain that might literally kill them by setting them up for diabetes, heart disease, and other deadly conditions.<br><br>Now recall the almost daily warnings about the growing amount of pollutants, toxins, and synthetic chemicals in our food, water, and air. The use of pesticides alone has doubled every ten years since 1945. Every day, corporations, cars, and homes release 700,000 tons of pollution into our air. Farmers spray seventy-two different pesticides on our fruits and veggies. Our cows and sheep are injected with estrogens to fatten them up and then stuffed with pesticide-laden grains to satisfy their artificial hunger.<br><br>Well, I'm here to tell you that there's a connection. Based on my twenty years as a practicing nutritionist, I see a clear link between rising levels of obesity and the fact that most of us are becoming more toxic every year.<br><br><b>1. Our bodies are staggering under the enormous load of industrial toxins that have entered our food, water, and environment&#x2014;and these toxins are making us fat</b>. First, we ingest the hormone-laden foods meant to fatten up cattle and sheep for market. Then our hormones are further disrupted by the pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and heavy metals that these poor animals consume with their feed. Finally, our poor polluted planet bombards us with new toxic invaders every day, from the methyl mercury in our fish, to the solvents in our acrylic nails, to the rocket fuel, of all things, that has seeped into the groundwater of twenty-two states. These toxins are in our homes, our workplace, our cosmetics, and our food. They're deadly to our health and disastrous for our weight.<br><br><b>2. Most of us eat far less fiber than we need and consume far more sugar, refined flour, saturated fats, and protein than we should.</b> In this toxic era, we need fiber more than ever, to help us neutralize the toxins and scrub them out of our system. A diet rich in whole grains, legumes, fruits, and fresh vegetables offers us plenty of fiber&#x2014;but how many of us eat that way? We're more likely to consume fatty, sugary, and floury foods or to go on the low-carb, low-fiber diets like Atkins and South Beach. Previous generations of Americans ate twenty to thirty grams of fiber per day. Our current average has dropped to less than twelve. So the food we eat sits in our colons for weeks, months, even years, where it slowly putrefies, bloating our stomachs and poisoning our bodies. Our poor, overloaded livers are supposed to detoxify our bodies, but they can't keep up with this toxic challenge. They do the best they can, but how can they properly metabolize fat when they're assaulted by this daily dose of toxins? Once again, we gain weight.<br><br><b>3. Low-carb diets are adding new stresses to our liver, colon, and entire digestive system.</b> Some people can lose weight on low-carb diets&#x2014;I'll be the first to admit it. But the long-term consequences of low-carb diets can be disastrous for both health and long-term weight loss. First, low-carb diets like Atkins and South Beach steer dieters toward high-protein foods like beef, chicken, fish, and pork&#x2014;the very foods simply loaded with the toxins we've just discussed. Then they urge dieters to avoid the fiber-rich fruits and vegetables that might help purify and eliminate those toxins. Finally, they load us up with so many proteins that we can't produce enough stomach acid to digest them all. Stress, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and poor eating habits have already deprived most Americans of the stomach acid we need. So we end up with an acid reflux epidemic while the undigested meat and cheese rots right there in our gut, overloading our liver and intestines with such poisons as indican, ammonia, cadaverine, and histidine. And&#x2014;you guessed it&#x2014;our weight continues to rise.<br><br>Clearly, we Americans are sorely in need of both <i>diet and detox</i>&#x2014;a safe, effective way to lose weight based on supporting our livers and colons. Maybe, I thought, the one-day weight-loss miracle that <i>Woman's World</i> had requested would allow me to kill two birds with one stone. With the right fast, dieters could lose significant amounts of weight virtually overnight, and they could also take advantage of fasting's age-old abil...</p><h2>Trinity Blood Volume 6</h2><p>In the dark and distant future, Armageddon has given rise to an eternal war between the humans, led by the Vatican, and the Methuselah Empire, the domain of the vampires!</p><p></p><h2>Shhh!

Two four-story bunk beds flank each spread, with a dog in each bed; Popov is snoring up a storm, so Nono climbs into Misha's bed for a story, waking the other dogs, who trade toys and glasses of water before all ending up piled up in a single bed together. <strong>The dogs' prickly personalities, de Monfried's enthusiastic cartooning, and an innately goofy premise deliver laughs with every page turn.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Kids and parents alike will relate to this humorous family story. Eight dogs in two tall bunk beds are sound asleep when Nono is awakened by another dog's snoring.

Each cartoon spread shows the same bedroom scene with a window in the center and a four-person bunk bed on each side. The ink and watercolor illustrations bring amusing detail to the story, and children will enjoy watching the characters move through the static background as the tale progresses.

To begin, all the lights are off and all the beds are filled, but someone is snoring and keeping someone else awake. Turn the page and click&#x2015;a light above the wakeful pup snaps on, and speech bubbles appear: "Are you asleep, Misha? Popov's making so much noise." The pups begin to wake one by one, all except snoring Popov, wanting one another's toys or some water or to sleep in someone else's bed. Before long, they all end up in Misha's bed listening to a story and falling asleep in a big snoring heap on the top bunk, leaving poor Popov to wonder where they've all gone. <strong>While minimal speech bubbles help convey some action, much of the plot is to be discovered in the funny, detail-rich illustrations, which children will enjoy poring over again and again.</strong> It's visually complex enough to make the usual board-book audience of babies and young toddlers a tad too young to appreciate it. <strong>Older toddlers and preschoolers will relate to these not-so-sleepy pups and delight in their evening escapades.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> </p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Soldier: Rise of the Jain, Book One</h2><p>"Neal Asher's books are like an adrenaline shot targeted directly for the brain."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John Scalzi <br><br><b>Humanity, artificial intelligences, and monstrous aliens clash over control of deadly technology in this explosive beginning to Neal Asher&#x2019;s newest Polity series.</b><br><br> In a far corner of space, on the very borders between humanity&#x2019;s Polity worlds and the kingdom of the vicious crab-like prador, is an immediate threat to all sentient life: an accretion disc, a solar system designed by the long-dead Jain race and swarming with living technology powerful enough to destroy entire civilizations. <br><br> Neither the Polity or the prador want the other in full control of the disc, so they&#x2019;ve placed an impartial third party in charge of the weapons platform guarding the technology from escaping into the galaxy: Orlandine, a part-human, part-AI haiman.

Her work has been anthologized in <i>Best American Poetry 2012, Los Angeles Review of Books Quarterly,</i> and <i>Troubling the Line: Trans &amp; Genderqueer Poetry &amp; Poetics.</i><strong> One of 45 Queer and Feminist Books You Need to Read in Early 2017, <em>Autostraddle</em></strong><br><br>"In this stunningly lyrical debut, Johnson probes issues of queer culture and love from an array of existential perspectives, creating a melodic and thought-provoking symphony on queer identity.... [A] miniature opus, alternately joyful and heartrending, achingly bittersweet."<br>&#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, starred review<br><br><br>"<em>In Full Velvet</em>&nbsp;is a sexy, smart, ardent, often pan-species paean to love, to queerness, to daring, to poems.... This irresistible book is a crucible of sexual and artistic becoming, of personhood and identity politics, all served up with force, formal deftness...and an enviable ear for the music of weeping and laughter that suffuse all lyric poetry.... [A] truly remarkable first collection."&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em><br>&nbsp;<br>"The queer and blazing ecosystem Johnson establishes situates dyke bars in forests and forests in dyke bars, under swells of gym-class parachutes, all rendered in the jazz of Johnson&#x2019;s lyricism. Vociferous, deciduous, fresh, and knowing, Johnson&#x2019;s poems create a space in which readers can reveal themselves and dig deep."<br>&#x2014;<em>Booklist</em><br><br>"Radical.... If <em>In Full Velvet</em> is a map of Johnson&#x2019;s mind and memory, it is one worth saving. Johnson is precise with herself, patient with others. These poems celebrate the feeling of spinning in tight circles until all that is left the spiral, rushing from the inside out."<br>&#x2014;<em>Ploughshares</em><br><br>&#x201c;The sheer joy of Jenny Johnson&#x2019;s poems finds fuel in the work of poets she loves (Hopkins, William Carlos Williams, Larry Levis), in the wild variety revealed by botany and zoology, in the insights of queer and gender theory, in dyke bars and dancing, and most of all in love and desire &#x2014; that imperative to which, directly or less so, every other element in this list is in service. When someone writes the history of American poetry in our time, the new energies released among the generation now publishing first books will be unmistakable; Johnson strides into a public space secured for her by Rich and Lorde and a host of others, and makes it brilliantly her own.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Mark Doty<br><br>"Maybe a voice from the ancients whispers to Jenny Johnson&#x2014;Sappho or the Muse Euterpe&#x2014;how to sing of love and death and joy and reality in as many registers as they come in life. Or maybe Johnson is just a genius. In either scenario (though the latter seems the obvious one) the pen of this poet flows with hard-won Old Soul ink&#x2014;blood and tears and juice and kisses. This breathtaking debut is erotic, sublime, dappled and riven with ripe fruit, wild body, and full-on fauna. Lesbian literary history (and the many queer-hearted literatures that keep us alive) has a new chapter here, inscribed In Full Velvet by this magnificently gifted poet."<br>&#x2014;Brenda Shaughnessy<br><br>&#x201c;Jenny Johnson describes the awkwardness and pain as well as the incalculable pleasure of living at odds with nature. Defiant, winking, and rippling with laughter, In Full Velvet walks us (in boy jeans) through a queer landscape of acrylic fur, dappled flanks, and antlers hot to the touch. This story of a &#x201c;heart hunting after a body&#x201d; does not promise full recovery: even better, it&#x2019;s an invitation to spend a few hours in the dyke bar at the end of the world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Heather Love<br><br>&#x201c;Pulsing with a formal brilliance and an idiosyncratic lyricism, these poems counter a poetics of ecological crisis by instead enacting a poetics of a shared world within which the human is one species among the species.... They pulse, too, with music and the grace of a world filled with strangeness and ardor. Johnson's diction, raucous and taut, reminds me that English is among the animal sounds we animals make. Like this, her poems enliven my seeing and my thinking about what a poem might do and what a world might be.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Aracelis Girmay<br><br>&#x201c;The rigor and formal poise of Jenny Johnson&#x2019;s work creates an astounding emotional tension. There&#x2019;s a sinuous, shape-shifting quality to this work that makes her poetic explorations of sex and selfhood all the more resonant. That subtle mastery of line and rhyme is a powerful complement to the poems&#x2019; organic commemorating, interrogating, searching. The judges were reminded of the virtuosity that characterizes a master like Elizabeth Bishop; of the profound and active depths, and how her poems ripple with need, and the desire for unity, communion, transformation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Whiting Awards Committee<br><br>&#x201c;Jenny Johnson is a poet of deep compassion and mesmerizing range. Her work probes the complexities of queer identity and the body, weaving in the unexpected reaches of intimacy and communion found in nature, dreams and lost family histories. The transformative power of community in the face of discrimination and intolerance is also felt throughout much of her work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The Rumpus</p><h2>Black Hills/White Justice: The Sioux Nation Versus the United States : 1775 to the Present</h2><p>Recounts the efforts of three generations of Sioux and their lawyers to gain compensation for the lost Black Hills and charts the history of broken treaties</p><p>A provocative, complex reexamination of the trail of broken promises marking historical relations between the US and the once- mighty Sioux nation, and the book debut of attorney/historian Lazarus, whose father met with substantial success after representing tribal interests in the federal judiciary for 20-odd years. Succinctly condensing the record of generally violent contact between whites and the Sioux tribes through the 19th century, including the signing of two major treaties in 1868 and 1877, Lazarus's narrative faces its real test in his subsequent treatment of the intricate legal maneuvering that began in the 1920's, as Sioux laments over the loss of their sacred Black Hills became a protracted struggle for rights by law. Through the tireless efforts of Ralph Case--portrayed here as a sympathetic, folksy attorney with romanticized ideas of the judicial process and a drinking problem--a flurry of claims was filed against the federal government on behalf of the Sioux; all were either dismissed or were still pending appeal after decades of litigation. New representation was sought as faith in Case declined in the 1950's, when Arthur Lazarus--a prot&#x201a;g&#x201a; of Felix Cohen, New Dealer and specialist in Native American law--and his associates were engaged. The ins and outs of 50 years of legal wrangling are the real focus here, with the discussion surprisingly lucid and readable given the technicalities involved. A valuable, well-informed contribution to the legal view of Native American history, despite necessary doubts about the author's impartiality, as when the relationship between his father and the Sioux went sour. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This comprehensive view of a 57-year legal battle puts the tragic plight of the Sioux Indians into focus with unusually sharp clarity. The Sioux's successful attempt to gain compensation for the U.S. government's 1877 takeover of their sacred Black Hills, in what is now South Dakota, led to a mostly hollow victory. The unprecedented $106 million awarded to the Sioux in a 1980 Supreme Court decision remains untapped by a destitute people, as tribal leaders pursue restoration of the land itself. Lazarus, the lawyer-son of one of the winning Sioux attorneys, Arthur Lazarus Jr., blames the "false hope" of the Sioux as he meticulously details the broken treaties and the lawsuit's serpentine path. Villains are charged, none more harshly than longtime Sioux attorney Ralph Case. The author, however, is guilty of seeking a lofty place in history for his much-assailed father. Still, while a tedious read, the book is an important addition to Native American history. $50,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Essential X-Men Volume 5 TPB</h2><p>Follows the adventures of the X-Men as they face numerous adversaries.</p><p></p><h2>Raven: A Trickster Tale from the Pacific Northwest</h2><p>Tale from the Pacific Northwest, fully illustrated version of how the RAVEN brought f=down the SUN to light the EARTH.</p><p></p><h2>The Short, Quick, Beginner&#39;s Prepper Manual: Getting Yourself Prepped in 30 Days or Less</h2><p>The Short, Quick, Beginner&#x2019;s Prepper Manual: Getting Yourself Prepped in 30 Days or Less is a quick, no nonsense, guide for people new to the emergency preparedness lifestyle, or what is known in some circles as prepping.

Rather, their aim is to show how theology can set out from hope and begin to consider its theme in an eschatological light. For this reason they inquire into the ground of the hope of Christian faith and into the responsible exercise of this hope in thought and action in the world today. The various critical discussions should not be understood as rejections and condemnations. They are necessary conversations on a common subject which is so rich that it demands continual new approaches.&#34;</p><p>&#39;With clear decisive strokes, Moltmann shows that for both Jews and Christians history is rooted in actual events and sets its sights on a real future in accordance with God&#39;s promises....

Despite now residing on opposite sides of England and enjoying totally independant lives, they continue to lecture and teach together and can often be seen demonstrating at national needlework exhibitions.

At the time, Rod Phelps, one of my Texas friends, asked me to talk with a new guy he was sending to see me. You must understand that in the music business, it's common courtesy to listen to your friends and spend time with the people they send you. Soon after talking with Rod, the new guy dropped by my office and played me some songs. I remember I didn't pull any punches; I told him his songs were only "fair."</p> <p>In the middle of our conversation, I was distracted when one of my writers�a guy with money problems-barged in. I asked my guest to excuse me a moment while I got the writer some paperwork to support a bank loan application. Later, I asked the new guy to keep the writer's situation confidential because it was a private matter. My guest responded, "Man, I recognize that writer. <i>He</i> needs a bank loan?" "Yeah! <i>Everybody</i> needs help now and then," I told him.</p> <p>Overhearing the conversation the guy caught the amount of money that the writer needed. My guest said he made more than that in a week playing in Oklahoma.</p> <p>"If that's the case, you'd better get on back to Oklahoma. You'll never make that kind of money playing the clubs in Nashville. I've got this saying: 'We create music in Nashville, and we sell it in Texas.' You can certainly include Oklahoma in there, too," I added.</p> <p> The new guy laughed, "Well I just can't believe that. What if I bring my whole band down here?"</p> <p>"How many is in your band?" I asked.</p> <p> "Five.�</p> <p> "Well," I said, "you and five other guys will starve to death in Nashville," I predicted.</p> <p>Sensing that I'd offended my guest, I tried to make amends by telling him, "Those are just the facts in this town. If you want to come here and write, if you want to make it as an artist, it's going to be tough. However, I'll be glad to help you. I'll see you at 9:00 tomorrow morning right here in my office. Since my friend, Rod, sent you to me, I'm going to do what I can to help you." Later, I learned that my guest had the use of Rod's personal credit cards so the guy could get to Nashville�that's how much Rod believed in his potential. "You be here at 9:00, and I'll help you find a place to live," I promised.</p> <p>Well, at 9:00 the next morning, the Oklahoma guy didn't show. I waited 'til about 10:30 before I called Rod and asked if he'd seen him. "No, I thought he was with you," was the response.</p> <p> I told Rod the guy was <i>supposed</i> to be with me. That bothered Rod because, well, this guy always kept his appointments. That afternoon, Rod called to let me know what had happened. His guy was all upset with me and was headed back to Oklahoma. I explained that all I did was just tell him the truth. "Man, if he can't take the truth, well, I'm sorry. I just told him the way things are in a detailed story of what has to be done to make it in Nashville.�</p> <p>That was the end of it�or so I thought. About a year later, this Oklahoma guy came back. But instead of seeing me, he walked right past my office and down the hall to talk with my associate. Soon after, the two of them struck a deal. I guess the guy didn't particularly want to see me. A few months later, this associate left ASCAP and opened a publishing company with the guy from Oklahoma.</p> <p>Several months later, I attended a "Writer's Night" at Nashville's Blue Bird Cafe. To my surprise, the Oklahoma guy was filling in for a writer who didn't show up. A few months later, he was signed to Capitol Records and recorded his first album. At that time, the president of Capitol Records was a friend of mine named Joe Smith. I sent Joe the guy's advance tape and told him to give special attention to this young man. I told Joe this guy was a friend of mine, and he's going to be a "monster" artist. Joe took my advice. Capitol Records spent a lot of money on the new artist and did everything necessary to help him become a huge success.</p> <p>After this guy hit the top, he told everybody who would listen that everything I'd said had been true. Since then, he has thanked me many times. Not long ago, the now legendary country star and I got together. He said, "Merle, you remember that first meeting we had in Nashville? Has it already been ten years? I'll <i>never</i> forget it!"</p> <p> This story just goes to show that it takes more than being friends�it takes talent, persistence, focus and hard work�to survive and become a superstar in the entertainment business.</p> <p>Just ask my friend, Garth Brooks.</p><br><br> <b><p> (c) 1998 Merlin Littlefield </p> </b><p>All rights reserved.

Area maps cover the obvious ground--there are chapters on school, sex, suicide, and so on--but it's the title of Chapter 2, "What They Do and Why," that best captures the book's spirit and technique. Anthony Wolf's modus operandi is not so much to make pronouncements about what parents should do, as to explain adolescent behavior in a way that's bound to leave parents with a changed view of the plausible options. Wolf is a clinical psychologist, and his writing is clear--even witty--and he doesn't resort to jargon. The expository text is punctuated with snatches of illustrative dialogue, which serve as concrete examples and help parents learn how to see, anticipate, and avoid "bad strategies." (One key mistake is getting dragged into no-win conflicts instead of having the wisdom to shut up at the moment when shutting up would be most effective--albeit the least satisfying--thing to do.) There are also some nicely tongue-in-cheek samples of "ideal" communication--the stuff we imagine might get said if only we were better parents. After one such rosily cooperative and considerate interchange between a father and his adolescent son, Wolf offers the following two-edged comfort: "The above conversation has never happened. Never. Not in the whole history of the world." Message: Parenting adolescents is inherently difficult. Don't judge your efforts by otherworldly standards. <i>--Richard Farr</i>Anthony E.

He was born in 1925 in Salina, Kansas and grew up in Kansas, Wyoming and Illinois. He graduated from University of Illinois College of Medicine in 1948. After his internship and two years of general surgery residency, he was activated into the Navy during the Korean War, serving for two years. The first eighteen months he was attached to the Second Marine Division at Camp LeJeune, North Carolina, and the last six months he was in charge of a thirty bed surgical ward at the U.S. Naval hospital there. Following military service, he entered general practice in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. He practiced eighteen years as a solo practitioner, delivering babies, performing major surgery, and all the things associated with being a general practitioner. In the fall of 1970, he joined The Bellaire Medical Group, an HMO based in the coalfields of West Virginia and Ohio where he served as Chief of the Department of Adult Medicine. In 1987 he left active practice and assumed a position as Medical Director of Miners Colfax Hospital in Raton, New Mexico. He retired after five years and began writing books. In the fall of 1987 while exhibiting his sculpture at an art show in Denver, he met Greg Satre who had a pottery booth next to him. He says their meeting was one of the most significant events of his life, ranking with his birth, graduating from medical school, and meeting his spirit guide, Pan. Throughout his entire life, he has been interested in philosophy and metaphysics. As a boy, he read Emerson and Lao Tse. Many metaphysical principles were incorporated into his practice. Some fifty years ago, through the use of hypnosis, he learned that we all experience multiple incarnations. This knowledge, coupled with metaphysical principles, was helpful in the recovery of many patient's illnesses and injuries.

Today, the movie business is just a small, highly visible outpost in a media universe controlled by six corporations&#x2013;Sony, Time Warner, NBC Universal, Viacom, Disney, and NewsCorporation. These conglomerates view films as part of an immense, synergistic, vertically integrated money-making industry. <br><br>In <i>The Big Picture</i>, acclaimed writer Edward Jay Epstein gives an unprecedented, sweeping, and thoroughly entertaining account of the real magic behind moviemaking: how the studios make their money. Epstein shows how, in Hollywood, the only art that matters is the art of the deal: major films turn huge profits, not from the movies themselves but through myriad other enterprises, such as video-game spin-offs, fast-food tie-ins, soundtracks, and even theme-park rides. <br><br>The studios may compete with one another for stars, publicity, box-office <br>receipts, and Oscars; their corporate parents, however, make fortunes <br>from cooperation (and collusion) with one another in less glamorous markets, such as cable, home video, and pay-TV. <br><br>But money is only part of the Hollywood story; the social and political milieus&#x2013;power, prestige, and status&#x2013;tell the rest. Alongside remarkable financial revelations, The Big Picture is filled with eye-opening true Hollywood insider stories. We learn how the promise of free cowboy boots for a producer delayed a major movie&#x2019;s shooting schedule; why stars never perform their own stunts, despite what the supermarket tabloids claim; how movies intentionally shape political sensibilities, both in America and abroad; and why fifteen-year-olds dictate the kind of low-grade fare that has flooded screens across the country. <br><br>Epstein also offers incisive profiles of the pioneers, including Louis B. Mayer, who helped build Hollywood, and introduces us to the visionaries&#x2013;Walt Disney, Akio Morita, Rupert Murdoch, Steve Ross, Sumner Redstone, David Sarnoff&#x2013;power brokers who, by dint of innovation and deception, created and control the media that mold our lives. If you are interested in Hollywood today and the complex and fascinating way it has evolved in order to survive, you haven&#x2019;t seen the big picture until you&#x2019;ve read <i>The Big Picture</i>.</p><p>Edward Jay Epstein is author of a number of books, including <i>Inquest: The Warren Commission</i>, <i>News from Nowhere: Television and the News</i>, <i>Establishment of Truth</i>, <i>Legend: Lee Harvey Oswald</i>,<i> </i>and<i> Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer</i>. He lives in New York City.Chapter 1<br><br>The Two Hollywoods<br><br>The Twilight of the Gods<br><br>On March 20, 1948, the elite of Hollywood, braving freezing temperatures and gale-force winds, filed past the newsreel cameras into the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for the twentieth annual presentation of the Academy Awards. Once inside, they discovered a stage that had been transformed into a towering birthday cake, with twenty giant Oscar statuettes in place of candles.<br><br>The studios had much to celebrate that night. Their movies, the most democratic of all art forms, had become the principal mode of paid entertainment for the vast majority of Americans. In an average week in 1947, 90 million Americans, out of a total population of only 151 million, went to a movie, paying on the average forty cents for a ticket. Nor was this massive outpouring, about two thirds of the ambulatory population, the product of expensive national marketing campaigns. It was simply the result of regular moviegoers going to see whatever was playing at their neighborhood theaters.<br><br>Most of these moviegoers didn&#x2019;t go to the theater to see a particular film. They went to see a program that included a newsreel; a short comedy film, such as the Three Stooges; a serial, such as Flash Gordon; animated cartoons, such as Bugs Bunny; a B feature, such as a western; and finally, the main attraction. In 1947 in America, movie houses were more ubiquitous than banks. There were more than eighteen thousand neighborhood theaters. Each had only one auditorium, one screen, one speaker (located behind the screen), one projection booth, and one marquee. Every week, usually on Thursday, a UPS truck picked up the previous week&#x2019;s reels and delivered the new ones. The new film&#x2019;s title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspapers constituted all the advertising most movies got.<br><br>Virtually all of these movies and shorts came from regional exchanges owned and operated by seven distribution companies that were, in turn, owned by seven Hollywood studios: Paramount, Universal, MGM, Twentieth Century&#x2013;Fox, Warner Bros., Columbia, and RKO. In little over a generation, these studios had perfected a nearly omnipotent mechanism for controlling what the American public saw and heard. It was known, collectively, as the studio system.<br><br>These studios had their common origins in the arcades, nickelodeons, and exhibition halls of the silent-film era. Their founders, self-made and self-educated Jews, had been part of the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century wave of immigration from Eastern Europe. They had worked at menial jobs as ragpickers, furriers, errand boys, butchers, junk peddlers, and salesmen and then gone into the business of showing movies. Here they found an enthusiastic audience, especially among those not yet fully literate in English, and a great deal of competition for it. To rise above their competitors, they instinctively sought what later economists would call &#x201c;economies of scale.&#x201d; Louis B. Mayer, the founder of MGM, borrowed money to expand from a single theater in Haverhill, Massachusetts, to a small group of theaters that he combined into a &#x201c;circuit&#x201d;&#x2014;so called because the reels of a single movie could be sent by bicycle from one theater to the next (with showtimes cut so close that sometimes one theater was showing the first reel of a film while another theater was showing the last), allowing multiple screenings of&#x2014;and multiple admissions for&#x2014;the movies he rented from film exchanges. As their circuits expanded, these entrepreneurs began opening their own film exchanges and distributing movies to other theater owners, but they still made most of their money from tickets bought at their own box office&#x2014;so called because the cash went into locked boxes.<br><br>When they found that they could not get enough movies on a regular basis from independent moviemakers, these new distributors took the next step and started making their own films. Initially, their studios were in the East, but as their production expanded after the turn of the century, they came under increased pressure from the Edison Trust, the legal entity formed by Thomas A. Edison to control the basic patents on movie cameras and projectors in America. The Trust filed a constant stream of lawsuits against the nascent film companies, who finally decided to relocate their studios a continent&#x2019;s width away from the reach of the Trust&#x2019;s East Coast lawyers. They chose the newly incorporated village of Hollywood, California&#x2014;a place they could control&#x2014;for their new home.<br><br>In less than a generation, these entrepreneurs had literally gone from rags (or furs) to riches. By the 1940s, the studio heads were among the highest-paid executives in the world. Having come from poverty, they reveled in this wealth and dubbed themselves moguls&#x2014;an appellation that, although perhaps not strictly appropriate since it originally referred to absolute Moslem rulers, became part of their identity. Louis B. Mayer, who had scavenged rags as a newly arrived immigrant and at nineteen did not have, as his son-in-law David O. Selznick later put it, &#x201c;the price of a sandwich,&#x201d; was in 1947 the highest-paid executive in America, with an annual salary from MGM of $1.8 million.<br><br>The studios produced nearly five hundred films in 1947&#x2014;features and B movies. While marketing strategies varied slightly from studio to studio, the movie business in 1947 was a relatively simple affair. The studios did not license their films to television or other media or license their characters for toys, games, T-shirts, or other merchandise. Foreign markets provided some revenue, but that income was mostly offset by high taxes&#x2014;Britain had a 75 percent import tax, for example&#x2014;and most European and Asian countries had restrictions on currency repatriation. As a result, profits from abroad were almost impossible to retrieve.<br><br>In short, studios looked to a single source for virtually all their money: the American box office. In 1947 the six major studios earned over 95 percent of their revenue from their share of ticket sales (called &#x201c;rentals,&#x201d; since it was technically the &#x201c;rent&#x201d; theaters paid for films) at North American movie houses. This came to $1.1 billion, which made movies, after grocery stores and automotive sales, America&#x2019;s third-largest retail business.<br><br>The studios were able to harvest this windfall extremely efficiently because they controlled almost all the movie theaters. MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, Twentieth Century&#x2013;Fox, and RKO had their own theater chains, which produced about half of their total revenue, while Columbia and Universal controlled chains of theaters less directly through their distribution arms. Among the theaters under studio control were most of the first-run houses in major cities in the United States and Canada, where films had their premieres. During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising. Thanks to their direct ownership of the theaters, studios were able to determine where, when, and for how long their films played in their first run. Such engagements could extend for many months while studios prepared the subsequent release to neighborhood theaters. For example, in 1947, Samuel Goldwyn&#x2019;s The Best Years of Our Lives was still playing at New York&#x2019;s Astor Theater, owned by MGM through its Loews subsidiary, six months after its premiere.<br><br>In addition, the studios indirectly controlled almost all independently owned theaters, which included most of the neighborhood and second-run movie houses, through ironclad contracts that forced the theater owners to commit to show a given number of films (usually ten) in a so-called block. If they did not accept a block, they got no studio films at all&#x2014;which meant they did not have the star names to attract an audience. Only a few dozen art theaters that showed foreign films could afford to turn down this &#x201c;blind-bidding&#x201d; arrangement.<br><br>Not only were the studios able to control the bookings of their films, but they enjoyed a monopoly on the resulting revenue. Stars, directors, writers, and other talent did not share in it. Neither did producers. In rare cases these participants might receive a share of the eventual profits, but never of the studio&#x2019;s rentals.<br><br>The studios were further aided by low distribution and marketing costs. Because films opened in only a handful of theaters in major cities before moving on to other regions, the same prints and posters could be used first in the Northeast and later on in the South and West. Distribution costs therefore were low, averaging only about $60,000 a film in 1947. Further, there were no national advertising campaigns, and since theaters paid a good part of local advertising and stars freely supplied the publicity on radio and in newsreels, the advertising budgets averaged less than $30,000 a picture.<br><br>What remained after these distribution and advertising costs were deducted from the rental revenue were the studios&#x2019; net receipts. In 1947 these totaled approximately $950 million.<br><br>To ensure a profit, studios obviously had to produce their films for less money than their net receipts totaled. To maximize their economies of scale, each studio had organized what amounted to a film factory, with staff and equipment that could operate around the clock. On their soundstages, shadowless light was cast by vast arrays of arc lamps, artificial weather was whipped up by wind, rain, and snow machines, and seas were created in indoor pools. On their back lots, exotic locales could be replicated and filled with extras dressed from the stocks of costumes and other props stored in their warehouses. For example, in 1947, MGM shot the adventure movie The Three Musketeers, wh...</p><h2>The Time of My Life</h2><p>In the public eye for much of the 1980s, Patrick Swayze made his name in movies such as Dirty Dancing and Ghost. This book chronicles Patrick&#39;s career, as well as dealing with his fight against pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Patrick Swayze was a three-time Golden Globe-nominated actor best known for his leading-man roles in two of the most beloved pictures of all time: &#34;Ghost&#34; and&#34;Dirty Dancing.&#34; Along with these high grossing, history-making films, many of his other movies have achieved a cult following, and his television series, &#34;The Beast,&#34; was a critical success. Also a singer/songwriter, dancer, and stage actor, Swayze grew up in Houston, Texas. He passed away in September 2009. Lisa Niemi wrote, directed and produced the film &#34;One Last Dance&#34; in 2004. She has held many film, television, and Broadway roles and also wrote, directed and starred in the play &#34;Without a Word&#34; with her husband, garnering six Drama Critics Awards. Before turning to directing and acting, Niemi began her professional life as a dancer. Lisa resides on a ranch outside Los Angeles.<b>Prologue</b><br><br><p>In late December 2007, life was looking pretty good. I had just wrapped shooting on the pilot of a new TV series, <i>The Beast.</i> My wife, Lisa, and I were enjoying a second honeymoon of sorts after a long, difficult period in which we had grown painfully apart. And I was feeling excited about new work, new directions, and the promise of the future.</p><p>Lisa and I were planning to spend New Year's Eve at our ranch in New Mexico, as we'd done for the past few years. But first, we stopped off in Aspen to visit a couple of friends. It was there that I got the first hint that something was wrong.</p><p>I had been having some digestive trouble, mostly acid reflux and a kind of bloated feeling, for a few weeks. I've had a sensitive stomach my whole life, so I hadn't thought much of it, but lately I just couldn't shake the constant discomfort. I wasn't hungry and felt sick whenever I did eat, but I'd always been pretty healthy, so I figured the feeling would pass eventually.</p><p>In Aspen, we all raised glasses of champagne for a toast. I took a sip, and as the champagne began to course through my esophagus to my stomach, I nearly choked -- it burned like acid going down. It felt like I'd drunk lye, a sharp, searing pain that brought tears to my eyes. I'd never felt anything like it, but not wanting to ruin the festivities, I said nothing to Lisa. I was used to ignoring pain, so I just didn't drink any more champagne that night, and didn't think anything more about it.</p><p>Three weeks later, in January 2008, I learned that the burning in my stomach wasn't some minor irritation. It was the result of blockage in my bile ducts, which was caused by pancreatic cancer -- just about the most deadly, untreatable cancer you can get.</p><p>When my doctor at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles said the words "pancreatic cancer," a single thought popped into my mind: I'm a dead man. That's what I had always thought when I heard someone had pancreatic cancer, and it usually turned out to be true. My doctor told me that my chances of surviving for more than a few months weren't high, and I had no reason to doubt him.<br></p><p>A lot of things go through your head when you get a death sentence handed to you, starting with <i>Why me? What did I do to deserve this? </i>Once the shock wears off, it's hard not to sink into bitterness, to feel that you've been singled out in a way that's not fair. For me, that initial shock quickly turned to selfcriticism and blame. <i>Did I do this to myself? What could I have done differently? Is it my fault?</i></p><p>In those first few weeks after my diagnosis, amid the whirlwind of figuring out treatments and medication, I struggled, with Lisa's help, to make sense of what was happening to me. Trying to counteract all the negative emotions that kept welling up -- anger, bitterness, despair -- I began thinking to myself, <i>I've had more lifetimes than any ten people put together, and it's been an amazing ride. So this is okay.</i></p><p>I was trying to find a way to accept what was going on, but then a funny thing happened. I just couldn't. I wasn't ready to go, and I was damned if this disease was going to take me before I was good and ready. So I said to my doctor, "Show me where the enemy is, and I will fight him." I wanted to understand exactly what I was up against so I could go after this cancer rather than waiting for it to beat me. And in the year and a half since my diagnosis, that's exactly what I've done, with every ounce of energy I have.</p><p>Fighting cancer has been the most challenging and eyeopening experience I've ever had, and it has sent me on an emotional journey deeper than anything I've felt before. Facing your own mortality is the quickest way possible to find out what you're made of. It strips away all the bullshit and exposes every part of you -- your strengths and weaknesses, your sense of self. Your soul.</p><p>It also leads you to confront life's hardest questions: Is there a heaven? Will I make it in? Has this life counted for something other than just my own narcissism? Have I lived a good life? Am I a good person? It's easy to dismiss these difficult questions when you have your whole life ahead of you. But when you're faced with your own mortality, they suddenly take on a whole new meaning.</p><p>There's a scene at the end of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> that really resonated with me when I first saw it, and it does now more than ever. As an old man, Private Ryan muses aloud about whether he's lived a good life. "I tried to live my life the best I could," he says. "I hope that was enough." It's so hard to judge your own life, to know whether you've made a mark in this world. Doing this book was, in part, a quest to find that out for myself.</p><p>I've never been one to spend a lot of time dwelling in the past, so spending time with Lisa looking back at our lives has been really illuminating. Especially in light of what our future now holds, it has also been cathartic. I never felt like I had all the answers, and I certainly don't claim to now. Yet the one thing I realized as Lisa and I retraced the arc of our lives is that no matter what happened, we never, ever gave up -- on each other, or on our dreams. I'm far from perfect, and I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. But that's one thing we both got right, and it's the one thing that's keeping me going today.</p><p>As I write this, sitting in our beautiful ranch home in New Mexico with the sun beaming down on the mountains, I realize yet again how much more I want to do in this life. Together with Lisa, I'll keep on pushing, keep on believing. Because that, in the end, is the greatest gift we have.</p><p><i>Patrick Swayze<br>June 2009</i><br></p><p>As Patrick and I have been writing this book, I couldn't help but be amazed by all the stories of things we've done and been through. It was surprising to me how hard we've both worked our whole lives, how focused and single-minded we could be. It must be the dancer in us. Always striving to be more, do better, never settle. And that drive to be better has served us well, particularly with all that we're going through now.</p><p>Looking back now, I wish I had done more of the proverbial "stop and smell the roses." So many gorgeous, beautiful things have happened in my life and I was too busy moving forward to really, truly recognize and enjoy them. I'm feeling different these days. Today I find myself much more willing to take luxurious, selfish pleasure in how beautiful a day is, the wonderful smell of my favorite mare's hair, and how much overflowing love I feel for my husband.</p><p>After Patrick was first diagnosed, I found myself wanting to go back in time and fix all the bumps that we had ever encountered. I wished we could start all over again so that this time we could do it differently. We could be wiser, avoid all those wrong turns we made, and not waste so much time. This time we would laugh more, touch each other more, and simply love each other in the way our true selves always have. And of course, if this daydream came true, I'd get a chance to live our lives together all over again, fulfilling my greatest wish -- to have more time with him.</p><p>In some ways, getting to do this book gave me a passport into the past. But not in the way I had thought. It couldn't elongate my time with him, but it did show me that some of those bumps I wished I could get rid of don't look so bad when we keep coming out on the other side. And they're a testament to the strength of what we are together.</p><p>You'd think that when someone close to you receives a death sentence it would inspire amazing insights and lessons about life. I know that's what I thought. But after his diagnosis, and after I started to recover from feeling I was trapped in a perpetual nightmare, I looked around and couldn't see a damn lesson in sight. Yet slowly, as I've been dealing with getting past the initial grief and fear, living each day that comes and running around preparing for all the things one can't possibly prepare for, the lessons have started to ease out into the open. I couldn't force them out any sooner. They come in their own time when they, and you, are good and ready.</p><p>There's a lot of wisdom in the idea of living one day at a time. And when you might not have someone for long, that's what starts to happen.</p><p>I used to be afraid of time -- that I'd run out of it, that I wouldn't have time to do all the things I wanted. Now I'm seeing each minute that passes as a victory. As something I'm proud of. It's like I can gather all these minutes into my arms as if they're an enormous mass of jewels. Look what I have -- another moment! A kiss, a stroke of the skin on my husband's arm, the light coming through the window just so...Each of these jewels gives me the confidence to stand up and look Death in the face and say, "No one's going anywhere today."</p><p>I can help Patrick -- I can coach him, love him, track his medications and calories, be there to kick him in the pants or just hold his hand if he needs it. But I can't save him. And I try to remember that. But I've got the best possible thing on my side: Patrick himself. I love that he's such a fighter. He's so amazingly strong and beautiful. He's my best weapon against this terrible disease.</p><p>You know, we were in New Mexico a couple of years after Patrick had broken both his legs in a life-threatening horse accident while filming <i>Letters from a Killer.</i> We walked out into the fresh mountain air, and he had taken off his shirt to enjoy the sun as we strolled into our beautiful fifty-acre pasture to visit with our five spirited Arabian horses. Patrick was rubbing one of the horses on her neck and I had walked off a ways for some reason or another. And I turned around just in time to see him grab a handful of mane and swing himself up on the mare's back. No saddle, no bridle, nothing.</p><p>She and the other horses started to trot off together and then, in a tight group, they launched into a full gallop, Patrick riding bareback in the middle of them through the open field. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't help but see how fantastic and free he looked. And I couldn't help but be piss...</p></p><h2>Cracking the Aging Code: The New Science of Growing Old - And What It Means for Staying Young</h2><p><p>A revolutionary examination of why we age, what it means for our health, and how we just might be able to fight it.</p><p>In <i>Cracking the Aging Code</i>, theoretical biologist Josh Mitteldorf and award-winning writer and ecological philosopher Dorion Sagan reveal that evolution and aging are even more complex and breathtaking than we originally thought. Using meticulous multidisciplinary science, as well as reviewing the history of our understanding about evolution, this book makes the case that aging is not something that &#x201c;just happens,&#x201d; nor is it the result of wear and tear or a genetic inevitability. Rather, aging has a fascinating evolutionary purpose: to stabilize populations and ecosystems, which are ever-threatened by cyclic swings that can lead to extinction. </p><p>When a population grows too fast it can put itself at risk of a wholesale wipeout. Aging has evolved to help us adjust our growth in a sustainable fashion as well as prevent an ecological crisis from starvation, predation, pollution, or infection.</p><p> This dynamic new understanding of aging is provocative, entertaining, and pioneering, and will challenge the way we understand aging, death, and just what makes us human.</p></p><p><p>Theoretical-biologist <b>Josh Mitteldorf</b> has a PhD from UPenn.

In this city, things are happening all the time, all over the place, and you don't have to be a detective to smell evil in the wind. <br> Take this week's tabloids: the face of a dead girl is splashed across the front page. She was found sprawled near a park bench not seven blocks from the police station. Detectives Carella and Brown soon discover the girl has a most unusual past. Meanwhile, the late-night news tracks the exploits of The Cookie Boy, a professional thief who leaves his calling card -- a box of chocolate chip cookies -- at the scene of each score. And while the detectives of the 87th Precinct are investigating these cases, one of them is being stalked by the man who killed his father. <br> Welcome to the Big Bad City.</p><p>Ed McBain is the only American winner of the coveted Diamond Dagger Award, and he is also a past recipient of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award. So, when a reader picks up the latest installment of McBain's 87th Precinct series, the bar is set pretty high. But with <i>The Big Bad City</i>, McBain meets expectations. <p> In the opening pages, Steve Carella and Artie Brown return to the department with 9 basketball players (the 10th player was murdered) only to discover a knife fight erupting in a holding cell. It's a steamy August night, and Carella and Detective Parker end up having to shoot one of the fighters to cool things down. Then Meyer and Kling enter the scene; they're hot in pursuit of the Cookie Boy, a thief who leaves chocolate-chip cookies at every crime sight. Before the interminable day is done, Carella and Brown are called out to Grover Park to investigate a homicide. A nun has been strangled to death, but she's no ordinary Sister. She's got signs of a breast augmentation operation that hint at a sordid past. Finally, readers are privy to a conversation between Juju and Sonny. Sonny killed a cop's dad, and Juju is convinced that the police will bend the rules to see that Sonny winds up dead. Juju insists that the only way out of the death trap is to kill the cop first. The officer's name is Steve Carella. And all of this happens in the first 15 pages.</p><p> McBain is one of the artists of the police procedural. Though his city is fictional, it breathes with the darkness and gritty reality of many American cities. He enters the minds and hearts of his characters to uncover the daily insecurities that accompany the work of policemen. Readers new to the 87th Precinct will want to venture back to such tales as 1956's <i>Cop Hater</i>, 1964's <i>Ax</i>, and 1965's <i>Doll</i>, among the 47 installments in this series. Those who've been along for the ride will be happy they did not give up their seat. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>The first thing you need to know about this city is that it is big.

Never mind the reassuring bulletins from the mayor's office; just watch the first ten minutes of the eleven o'clock news and you'll learn exactly what the people of this city are capable of doing to other people in this city. So, if you came here thinking, Gee, there's going to be a neat little murder that takes place in a town house and some blue-haired lady will solve it, then you came to the wrong city at the wrong time of year. In this city, you have to pay attention.

Behind the scenes, detectives Carella and Brown soon discover that this is not your average dead girl, but one with an unusual past.

Each of the Rizzoli Quadrifolios features sixteen foldout pages that open into huge poster-sized reproductions of the work, allowing readers to feel as though they have leaped into work itself. The series begins with two artists whose work continually compels audiences: Michelangelo and Van Gogh. Vincent Van Gogh features a variety of the best-known paintings by the Dutch artist, whose work continually breaks records at auctions. A tour of Van Gogh's portraits will travel to major American museums throughout 200 and 2001.<br></p><p>No other painter better embodies the idea of the tortured artist than <i>Vincent van Gogh</i>. Modern-art historian Meyer Schapiro recognizes this when he states that "what is most important is that van Gogh converted all this aspiration and anguish into his art, which thus became the first example of a truly personal art, art as a deeply lived means of spiritual deliverance or transformation of the self...." What naturally follows from Schapiro is not only a synopsis of van Gogh's artistic career and personal travails, but also an insightful analysis of van Gogh's technique and handling of paint, and how they manipulate the viewer's emotional response to his paintings. With a sympathetic yet penetrating essay by Schapiro, this book is a pleasure to read for van Gogh enthusiasts of any level. The more expert art historian might prefer van Gogh's drawings, of which approximately 20 are reproduced here in black and white. It is for his paintings, however, that one admires van Gogh, and this book's 49 full-page color plates with accompanying comments by Schapiro are its strength. <i>Van Gogh</i> contains works from no less than 30 different worldwide collections to better represent all phases of the artist's development, and includes his most famous and best-loved works.Francesca Castria is an expert on nineteenth- and twentieth -century art and has collaborated with Stefano Zuffi on both <i>Art in Venice</i> and <i>Italian Painting.</i></p><h2>Firefly Summer</h2><p>It was a summer of warmth....

Reprint.</p><p><i>Archangel</i> is a remarkably literate novel--and simultaneously a gripping thriller--that explores the lingering presence of Stalin amidst the corruption of modern-day Russia. Robert Harris (whose previous works include <i>Enigma</i> and <i>Fatherland</i>) elevates his tale by choosing a narrator with an outsider's perspective but an insider's knowledge of Soviet history: Fluke Kelso, a middle-aged scholar of Soviet Communism with a special interest in the dark secrets of Joseph Stalin. For years, rumors have circulated about a notebook that the aging dictator kept in his final years. In a chance encounter in Moscow, Kelso meets Papu Rapava, a former NKVD guard who claims that he was at Stalin's deathbed and says that he assisted Politburo member Beria in hiding the black oilskin notebook just as Stalin was passing. Before Kelso can get more details, Rapava disappears, but the scholar is energized by the evidence Rapava has provided. As Kelso begins to pursue his historical prize, however, his investigation ensnares him in a living web of Stalinist terror and murder. It soon becomes clear that the notebook is the key to a doorway hiding many secrets, old and new. <p> Harris's understanding of Soviet and modern Russian is impressive. The novel rests on a seamless blend of fact and fiction that places real figures from Soviet history alongside Kelso and his fictional colleagues.

Most Civil War accounts treat of battles and armies. The focus of this exciting account is sharper, narrower: a single brigade, the basic unit of attack of one of those armies.<br><br>The Stonewall Brigade and its first commander, Thomas J. Jackson, won their nickname at the bloody baptism of First Manassas. Over the next four years "Jackson&#x2019;s foot cavalry" achieved fame and sustained losses matched by few American military units before or since. There were some 2,600 men serving in the brigade at the start of the war. At Appomattox-thirty-nine engagements later-only 210 remained, none above the rank of captain. But these men from out of the Valley of Virginia had written their names upon the pages of history.<br><br>In <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i> the author, a distinguished scholar of the Civil War, has given equal billing with the immortal Jackson to such soldiers as Lieutenant David Barton, Captain Kyd Douglas, and Private John Casler. He has attempted to capture the camp life, the marches, the personal experiences in battle rather than concentrate on well-known strategy and familiar Confederate leaders. Similarly, descriptions of battles are written from within the ranks rather than from command posts. The result is a vivid and often moving account of courage and cowardice, triumph and heartbreak-and endurance perhaps without parallel.</p></p><p>A valuable and entertaining document that should find a place among the enduring books on the Civil War.James I.

Some postulated that it had been stolen by Satanists. Some said the priest himself was to blame. Some even pointed their fingers at the Vatican. In 2006, travel writer David Farley moved to Calcata, determined to find the missing foreskin, or at least find out the truth behind its disappearance. Farley recounts how the relic passed from Charlemagne to the papacy to a marauding sixteenth-century German solider before finally ending up in Calcata, where miracles occurred that made the sleepy town a major pilgrimage destination. Over the centuries, as Catholic theology evolved, the relic came to be viewed as something of an embarrassment, culminating in a 1900 Church decree that allowed the parish to display it only on New Year's Day.<br><br> <i>An Irreverent Curiosity</i> interweaves this history with the curious landscape of Calcata, a beautiful and untouched medieval village set atop four-hundred-fifty-foot cliffs, which now, due to the inscrutable machinations of Italian bureaucracy, is a veritable counterculture coven. Blending history, travel, and perhaps the oddest story in Christian lore, <i>An Irreverent Curiosity</i> is a weird and wonderful tale of conspiracy and misadventure.</p><p><b>DAVID FARLEY</b>'s travel writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i> (including a feature on Calcata), <i>The Washington Post, Condé Nast Traveler, Slate</i>, and many other publications. He teaches writing at <i>New York University</i>.Until one mysterious day in 1983, the foreskin of Jesus&#x2014;once one of the Catholic Church's holiest of relics&#x2014;lay nestled in a box in a small church in Calcata, a village in the hills of northern Italy. On that fateful day in December, however, priest Don Dario announced to his tiny congregation that the foreskin had disappeared. What happened to this holy relic? Who could have taken this piece of the divine that medieval saint Catherine of Siena was purported to have worn as a ring around her finger and about which writers as diverse as Joyce, Stendhal and Jos� Saramago have written? In this humorous narrative, journalist Farley sets off to solve the mystery of the missing foreskin. Part travelogue, part mystery story and part religious history, Farley's tale involves local winemakers, actors and priests, many of whom are tight-lipped about the relic's disappearance. In 1900, the Vatican decreed that anyone who talked about the holy foreskin would face excommunication, and thereby cut off its status as a holy relic. Farley discovers that no one really knows whether this piece of holy skin ever existed in the first place, and that no one knows its whereabouts now. Although Farley's often repetitious tale might have been sufficient as a magazine article, his fast-paced storytelling and winning humor raise thoughtful questions about the nature of faith. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Consisting of gorgeous prints of water life paired with brief reflections by the artist, the physical texture of the book-from the cloth cover to the handmade paper pages-serves as a rich complement to the visual texture of the silk-screened images. Jha presents his own interpretations of the traditional motifs found in Mithila art, a pattern-rich form of folk painting from the Bihar region of eastern India. The audience for this art book is somewhat unclear as the volume has no cohesive narrative and the artist's notes on what inspired the images or how the artistic decisions were made are not informative enough to be educational. However, it could have a place in art curriculums as style inspiration or as an exhibition of one artist's work, especially where there is a need for multicultural art.

In the Best Families deals with Mrs. Rackam, an aging millionaire who approaches Wolfe to investigate why her young and penniless husband suddenly and mysteriously has large sums of money. Wolfe's inquiry leads him to a confrontation with Arnold Zeck; later a letter bomb causes Wolfe to resign from detective work and go into hiding, leaving his assistant, Archie Goodwin, to solve the case. Has Wolfe's career ended in humiliation? Only time will tell. Michael Pritchard's clear and strong reading helps support the tale. Rachel Bruner, a wealthy society widow, turns to Wolfe in The Doorbell Rang. She writes him a check for $100,000 and asks him to stop the FBI from spying on her and her family. She will pay more if he is successful. He takes the case, and soon Wolfe and Archie are confronting FBI agents, murder, and threats as they search for answers. Champagne for One challenges Wolfe's knowledge of gourmet food and of sleuthing. Did society girl Faith Usher commit suicide via cyanide in her champagne, or was she murdered? Archie was there, and he suspects foul play. Saul Rubinek provides pleasant readings of both stories and helps keep the atmosphere charged. Although abridged, The Doorbell Rang/Champagne for One provides more entertainment than In the Best Families and is recommended.ADenise A. Garofalo, Mid-Hudson Lib.

The next morning Andrew Johnson was suddenly elevated to the position of President of the United States at a time when the nation was still suffering from the effects of war. This biography explores the enigma of the homeless and uneducated tailor whose spectacular rise to power ended in disgrace. It relates how his term in office undermined the process of reconstruction and left a legacy of racism. Over a century later, Johnson remains the only president of the United States to have been impeached. The author explores Johnson&#39;s undeniable skills as a political leader and his stubborn attachment to a mythical view of the America of his youth, which proved to be his undoing.</p><p>Hans L. Trefousse is professor of history at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. His other books include The Radical Republicans, a pathbreaking history of Reconstruction.Known for his Carl Schurz: A Biography (LJ 2/15/82), Trefousse delivers the first Johnson study in years, a definitive assessment of his career and presidency. Johnson's papers and other sources reveal his fatal idealization of the agrarian utopia, his fierce advocacy of strict Constitutional constructionism, and his imprudent insistence upon the Republican party's adoption of his views on race. Trefousse demonstrates that Johnson, because of his upbringing, was out of step with the great changes emerging at the end of the Civil War. His stubborn attachment to his increasingly archaic views was responsible for his political and military success, but also for his impeachment. A brilliant, compassionate portrait of a dynamic era of social change and national healing, and of the tragic failure of an American leader. Not to be missed.<br><i>- Susan E.

At the height of their powers they were known as &#x2018;the twins&#x2019;, and their works proved popular translated into English. After their deaths, however, they slipped into obscurity; and apart from the odd tale reprinted in anthologies, their work has remained difficult to find and to appreciate.</p><p>In <em>The Invisible Eye</em>, veteran horror anthologist Hugh Lamb has collected together the finest weird tales by Erckmann&#x2013;Chatrian. The world of which they wrote has long since vanished: a world of noblemen and peasants, enchanted castles and mysterious woods, haunted by witches, monsters, curses and spells. It is a world brought to life by the vivid imagination of these authors and praised by successors including M.R. James and H. P. Lovecraft. With an introduction by Hugh Lamb, and in paperback for the first time, this collection will transport the reader to the darkest depths of the nineteenth century: a time when anything could happen &#x2013; and occasionally did.</p></p><p><p>Hugh Lamb has spent over forty years delving into weird fiction.

As the key theater of the war for the Germans, the eastern front consumed enormous levels of resources and accounted for 75 percent of all German casualties. Despite the significance of this campaign to Germany and to the war as a whole, few English-language publications of the last thirty-five years have addressed these pivotal events.<br><br>In <i>Ostkrieg: Hitler's War of Extermination in the East</i>, Stephen G. Fritz bridges the gap in scholarship by incorporating historical research from the last several decades into an accessible, comprehensive, and coherent narrative. His analysis of the Russo-German War from a German perspective covers all aspects of the eastern front, demonstrating the interrelation of military events, economic policy, resource exploitation, and racial policy that first motivated the invasion.

Some say he would become a great moral leader. Others, a social critic. Still others view Jesus as a profound philosopher, a rabbi, a feminist, a prophet, and more. Many are convinced he was the divine Son of God. Who was he&#x2014;really? And how can you know for sure? Consulting experts on the Bible, archaeology, and messianic prophecy, Lee Strobel searches out the true identity of the child in the manger.

When I first met soft-spoken Leo Carter, he was a seventeen-year-old veteran of Chicago&#39;s grittiest neighborhood. His testimony had put three killers in prison. And he was still carrying a .38-caliber slug in his head---a grisly reminder of a horrific saga that began when he witnessed Elijah Baptist gun down a local grocer. Leo and a friend, Leslie Scott, were playing basketball when they saw Elijah, then sixteen years old, slay Sam Blue outside his grocery store. Leo had known the grocer since childhood. &#39;When we didn&#39;t have any food, he&#39;d give us some,&#39; Leo explained to me. &#39;So when I went to the hospital and they said he was dead, I knew I&#39;d have to testify about what I saw.&#39; Eyewitness testimony is powerful. One of the most dramatic moments in a trial is when a witness describes the crime that he or she saw and then points confidently toward the defendant as being the perpetrator. Elijah Baptist knew that the only way to avoid prison would be to somehow prevent Leo Carter and Leslie Scott from doing just that. So Elijah and two of his pals staged an ambush. Leslie and Leo&#39;s brother, Henry, were brutally murdered, while Leo was shot in the head and left for dead. But somehow, against all odds, Leo lived. The bullet, in a place too precarious to be removed, remained in his skull. Despite searing headaches that strong medication couldn&#39;t dull, he became the sole eyewitness against Elijah Baptist and his two cohorts. His word was good enough to land them in prison for the rest of their lives. Leo Carter is one of my heroes. He made sure justice was served, even though he paid a monumental price for it. When I think of eyewitness testimony, even to this day--- thirty years later---his face still appears in my mind.2 TESTIMONY FROM DISTANT TIME Yes, eyewitness testimony can be compelling and convincing. When a witness has had ample opportunity to observe a crime, when there&#39;s no bias or ulterior motives, when the witness is truthful and fair, the climactic act of pointing out a defendant in a courtroom can be enough to doom that person to prison or worse. And eyewitness testimony is just as crucial in investigating historical matters---even the issue of whether the Christmas manger really contained the unique Son of God. But what eyewitness accounts do we possess? Do we have the testimony of anyone who personally interacted with Jesus, who listened to his teachings, who saw his miracles, who witnessed his death, and who encountered him after his alleged resurrection? Do we have any records from first-century &#39;journalists&#39; who interviewed eyewitnesses, asked tough questions, and faithfully recorded what they scrupulously determined to be true? I knew that just as Leo Carter&#39;s testimony clinched the convictions of three brutal murderers, eyewitness accounts from the mists of distant time could help resolve the most important spiritual issue of all. To get solid answers, I flew to Denver to interview a scholar who literally wrote the book on the topic: Dr. Craig Blomberg, author of The Historical Reliability of the Gospels. INTERVIEW: CRAIG L. BLOMBERG, PHD Craig Blomberg is widely considered one of the country&#39;s foremost authorities on the biographies of Jesus, which are called the four gospels. He received his doctorate in New Testament from Aberdeen University in Scotland, later serving as a senior research fellow for Tyndale House at Cambridge University in England, where he was part of an elite group of international scholars that produced a series of acclaimed works on Jesus. He is currently a professor of New Testament at Denver Seminary. As he settled into a high-back chair in his office, cup of coffee in hand, I too sipped some coffee to ward off the Colorado chill. Because I sensed Blomberg was a get-tothe- point kind of guy, I decided to start my interview by cutting to the core of the issue. &#39;Tell me this,&#39; I said with an edge of challenge in my voice, &#39;is it really possible to be an intelligent, critically thinking person and still believe that the four gospels were written by the people whose names have been attached to them?&#39; Blomberg set his coffee cup on the edge of his desk and looked intently at me. &#39;The answer is yes,&#39; he said with conviction. He sat back and continued. &#39;It&#39;s important to acknowledge that strictly speaking, the gospels are anonymous. But the uniform testimony of the early church was that Matthew, also known as Levi, the tax collector and one of The Eyewitness Evidence 15 the twelve disciples, was the author of the first gospel in the New Testament; that John Mark, a companion of Peter, was the author of the gospel we call Mark; and that Luke, known as Paul&#39;s &#39;beloved physician,&#39; wrote both the gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles.&#39; &#39;How uniform was the belief that they were the authors?&#39; I asked. &#39;There are no known competitors for these three gospels,&#39; he said. &#39;Apparently, it was just not in dispute.&#39; Even so, I wanted to test the issue further. &#39;Excuse my skepticism,&#39; I said, &#39;but would anyone have had a motivation to lie by claiming these people wrote these gospels, when they really didn&#39;t?&#39; Blomberg shook his head. &#39;Probably not. Remember, these were unlikely characters,&#39; he said, a grin breaking on his face. &#39;Mark and Luke weren&#39;t even among the twelve disciples. Matthew was, but as a former hated tax collector, he would have been the most infamous character next to Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus! &#39;Contrast this with what happened when the fanciful Apocryphal Gospels were written much later. People chose the names of well-known and exemplary figures to be their fictitious authors---Philip, Peter, Mary, James. Those names carried much more weight than the names of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. So to answer your question, there would not have been any reason to attribute authorship to these three less respected people if it weren&#39;t true.&#39; That sounded logical, but it was obvious that he was leaving out one of the gospel writers. &#39;What about John?&#39; I asked. &#39;He was extremely prominent; in fact, he wasn&#39;t just one of the twelve disciples but one of Jesus&#39; inner three, along with James and Peter.&#39;</p><h2>COMMON AS AIR</h2><p><p><i>Common as Air </i>offers a stirring defense of our cultural commons, that vast store of art and ideas we have inherited from the past and continue to enrich in the present. Suspicious of the current idea that all creative work is "intellectual property," Lewis Hyde turns to America's Founding Fathers&#x2015;men such as Adams, Madison, and Jefferson&#x2015;in search of other ways to imagine the fruits of human wit and imagination. What he discovers is a rich tradition in which knowledge was assumed to be a commonwealth, not a private preserve.</p><p>For the founders, democratic self-governance itself demanded open and easy access to ideas. So did the growth of creative communities such as that of eighteenth-century science. And so did the flourishing of public persons, the very actors whose "civic virtue" brought the nation into being.</p><p>In this lively, carefully argued, and well-documented book, Hyde brings the past to bear on present matters, shedding fresh light on everything from the Human Genome Project to Bob Dylan's musical roots. <i>Common as Air </i>allows us to stand on the shoulders of America's revolutionary giants and thus to see beyond today's narrow debates over cultural ownership.

In response, the pharmaceutical industry called the move illegal and ill conceived, claiming it undermined the incentive to conduct the very research that produces AIDS drugs in the first place.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Fox News insisted that you tube remove from its site a John McCain commercial that used unauthorized video from a Fox-moderated debate. When the McCain campaign complained about suppression of political speech, you tube replied that copyright law gave them no choice, though they &#x201c;look[ed] forward to working with Senator (or President) McCain&#x201d; to improve the law.In 2000, a British scholar published a 1, 300-page anthology of modern Irish writing, twenty-four pages of which were devoted to James Joyce. Asked for permission, the Joyce estate insisted on a fee of �7,000. When the editor wrote saying he couldn&#x2019;t afford such a steep fee, the estate raised the price to �7,500, then changed its mind and refused permission outright. Ten years later, this anthology still lists Joyce&#x2019;s work in the table of contents, but pages 323 through 346 are cut from the volume.Each of these stories revolves around what we now call &#x201c;intellectual property,&#x201d; and as modern as these cases are, the question behind them is very old: in what sense can someone own, and therefore control other people&#x2019;s access to, a work of fiction or a public speech or the ideas behind a drug? The literary part of this puzzle has, by itself, a long history. Three hundred years ago in England, writers and publishers engaged in a spirited, fifty-year debate over whether or not there could even exist such a thing as &#x201c;literary property.&#x201d;Publishers in Scotland, for example, thought it made no sense for their competitors in London to claim exclusive ownership of, say, a book on oratory by Cicero or a popular poem like James Thomson&#x2019;s The Seasons. As one aggrieved Scot tried to explain, if a writer were to &#x201c;keep his Lucubrations to himself,&#x201d; then perhaps &#x201c;he may be said to have a Property in his Noddle.&#x201d; But once &#x201c;he prints . . . these Lucubrations,&#x201d; and once someone else pays for the book and reads it, &#x201c;the Person who buys has just the same Property that the Author had.&#x201d;&#x201c;To lucubrate&#x201d;: surely this is a key forgotten verb of the European Enlightenment, the root (&#x201c;lux&#x201d;) being light itself and the action indicated being the labor of studying long into the night by the flame of a lamp. Lucubrations are the mental harvest of midnight oil, and the only way to make them &#x201c;property&#x201d; in the usual sense (&#x201c;this is mine; you keep out&#x201d;) would be to keep them locked inside the skull, or so this Scottish publisher believed against the protestations of his London rivals.Centuries have passed since arguments of this sort first appeared, but the years have neither laid them to rest nor brought much clarity to the terms of engagement. &#x201c;Intellectual property&#x201d; is the phrase now used to denote ownership of art and ideas, but what exactly does it mean? Does it make sense, to begin with, to say that &#x201c;intellect&#x201d; is the source of the &#x201c;properties&#x201d; in question? A novel like Ulysses, the know-how for making antiviral drugs, Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x2019;s &#x201c;Dream&#x201d; speech, the poems of Rimbaud, Andy Warhol screen prints, Mississippi Delta blues, the source code for electronic voting machines: who could name the range of human powers and historical conditions that attends such creations? All that we make and do is shaped by the communities and traditions that contain us, not to mention by money, power, politics, and luck. And even should the artist or scientist think she has extracted herself from the world to stand alone in the studio, a tremendous array of faculties and mind-states may well attend her creativity.There is intellect, of course, but also imagination, intuition, sagacity, persistence, prudence, fantasy, lust, humor, sympathy, serendipity, will, prayer, grief, courage, visual acuity, ambition, guesswork, mother wit, memory, delight, vitality, venality, kindness, generosity, fortitude, fear, awe, compassion, surrender, sincerity, humility, and the ability to integrate diametrically opposed states of mind into harmonious wholes . . . We would need quite a few new categories to fully map this territory&#x2014;&#x201c;dream property,&#x201d; &#x201c;courage property,&#x201d; &#x201c;grief property&#x201d;&#x2014;and even if we had that list, only half the problem would have been addressed.For what exactly is &#x201c;property&#x201d;? The oil in a lamp, the light it sheds, the midnight scholar&#x2019;s flash of insight: can each of these be &#x201c;property&#x201d; and, if so, by what ample definition of the term?I will have more to say about these questions in the chapter that follows; here I&#x2019;ll simply acknowledge that my own position is not as extreme as that of the Scottish publisher. I believe there can be property in all sorts of lucubrations and, in a rightly limited form, usefully so. The very first copyright law (Britain&#x2019;s 1710 Statute of Anne) gave &#x201c;the Authors and Proprietors&#x201d; of books exclusive rights to their works for as long as twenty-eight years, provided that they paid a sixpenny fee and listed their works &#x201c;in the Register-Book of the Company of Stationers.&#x201d; For most of the twentieth century, the law in the United States was much the same: rights lasted twenty-eight years (and could be renewed once, if the owner cared) provided that works were duly registered with the copyright office. Both of these seem to me to offer sensible ways to manage the &#x201c;intellectual property&#x201d; found in books.That said, part of the task of this book is to show the degree to which a phrase like &#x201c;intellectual property&#x201d; serves simply to obscure a long history of philosophical, legal, and ethical argument about what sort of property lies under that heading and, once that&#x2019;s decided, what &#x201c;rightly limited&#x201d; should mean and why a limit to ownership might arise in the first place. Knowing the history of that debate not just well enough to follow the argument but well enough to engage with it, to take an informed position in the debate, is to my mind one of the prerequisites of cultural citizenship in the twenty-first century.But here we come to another topic that informs this book, for cultural citizenship is itself now highly contested, sufficiently so that I take it to be the site of a new culture war. For a quick overview of the terms under which that war is being waged, one could do worse than begin with a look at the public relations campaigns that the U.S. entertainment industries have been funding, especially the antipiracy curricula that they have developed and distributed to public schools.One such campaign, produced by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), has now reached hundreds of thousands of children in classrooms from New York to Los Angeles. In most schools, teachers have been free to use the offered lesson plans or not, as they see fit, though not in California, where a 2006 law mandates that all public schools must develop an &#x201c;education technology&#x201d; plan in which, for example, &#x201c;the implications of illegal peer-to-peer network file sharing&#x201d; must be taught. (The law never mentions teaching the more interesting and revolutionary implications of legal file sharing.) The year 2006 was also when the industry persuaded the Boy Scouts in Los Angeles to offer a &#x201c;Respect Copyright&#x201d; merit badge; the MPAA wrote the curriculum for that, too.Many of the assignments in these programs depend on role-playing exercises. The merit badge curriculum suggests, for example, that each Boy Scout &#x201c;write and perform a skit about why copyright protection is important.&#x201d; Elementary school children get to create greeting cards and posters and hold a &#x201c;publication party,&#x201d; at the culmination of which each child writes his or her name on a sticker that says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re part of the � TEAM!&#x201d; and then affixes this notice to the back of the work. The sticker bears a stock &#x201c;All rights reserved&#x201d; copyright declaration.In an even more elaborate exercise called &#x201c;Living in a Fishbowl,&#x201d; the teacher gives the students cards assigning each of them to one of six roles, five of which pertain directly to conventional motion picture production: actor, set carpenter, singer, director, and producer. The sixth role is a &#x201c;computer user.&#x201d; The movie people all have jobs and a clear story to tell: they work hard to make movies; copyright law rewards and protects that work, piracy threatens and destroys it. Online file-swapping, a typical character says, &#x201c;is costing me big bucks . . . [It] just isn&#x2019;t fair.&#x201d; The computer user, on the other hand&#x2014;pictured with the top of his head missing and stars shooting out of it&#x2014;offers an incoherent ramble that mixes rhetorical questions (&#x201c;How could it possibly be illegal . . . ?&#x201d;) with dismissive remarks (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really no big deal!&#x201d;). He seems to have no job.The students break into groups to talk about how to present each of these characters to the class; then one by one each student must sit in a circle of chairs&#x2014;the &#x8;...</p><h2>God&#39;s Echo: Exploring Scripture with Midrash</h2><p><p>The Rabbis of old believed that the Torah was divinely revealed and therefore contained eternal, perfect truths and hidden meaning that required elucidation.

Unbeknownst to most people, a group of benevolent witches are hard at work keeping the world--and Great Britain in particular--safe from evil and destruction. Meanwhile, from their vantage point in another universe, the celibate magicians of Arth are busy spying on earth, and sending any likely-seeming ideas and inventions back to their own home planet, a Pentarchy--a world where magic is rife and originality is absent. Not satisfied with simply stealing ideas that already exist, Arth's magicians have taken to dispatching various disasters to earth (the latest is global warming) in order to learn from its inhabitants' reactions. Fed up with Arth's practice of using their world as a giant lab animal, earth's witches fill a magical bus with enchantresses and send it to Arth, with orders to make as much trouble as possible. They do. Matters are further complicated when a young woman (who may or may not be an embodiment of the Great Goddess) stows herself and her toddler son onto the witches' bus. Because there are a great many details that must be established before Jones can begin telling her story, the novel's first few chapters are relatively slow going. However, once the large cast of characters has been introduced and the three distinct worlds sketched out, the narrative careens ahead at a merry, headlong pace. Jones's sly sense of humor and her accurate, affectionate depiction of relations between women and men give an extra kick to this effervescent tale. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Health Preserver : Defining the Versatility of Vitamin E</h2><p>Describes the numerous therapeutic uses of vitamin E, focusing on success in the alleviation of coronary problems as well as bone ailments and eye and skin-related problems</p><p></p><h2>The No-Sided Professor</h2><p>Here is Martin Gardner&#39;s first collection of short stories.

His repertoire ranging from boogie-woogie, swing, and bebop to free form, fusion, and whatever, Sun Ra was above all a paragon of contradictions: profundity and vaudeville; technical pianistic virtuosity and irony; assiduous attention to arrangements and encouragement of collective improvisation; respect for tradition and celebration of the fresh.<br><br>Some might have been bemused by his Afro-Platonic neo-hermeticism; others might have laughed at his egregious excesses.

These memoirs, short stories, and poems reflect the joys and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perils of growing up in a subculture defined by its opposition to some<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of society's most deeply held values. How red diaper babies have come<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to terms with their political inheritance is the theme of this compelling<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anthology.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some contributors have fond<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; memories of family activism; others recall the past with ambivalence or<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even pain. The authors range in age from their twenties to their eighties.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, such as Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein and sixties activist Bettina<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aptheker, are widely known themselves; some are the children of well-known<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American leftists, including Jeff Lawson, son of blacklisted screenwriter<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Howard Lawson, and Robert Meeropol, son of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In disparate voices, the contributors elaborate on how their parents attempted<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pass on to them the torch of radical politics.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>In recent books, such as Lisa Michaels' <i>Split</i> [Je 1 98], authors in their 20s have described their "counterculture childhoods." This collection looks several decades farther back, gathering memoirs of "red diaper babies" whose parents were members or former members of the U.S. Communist Party or nonmembers involved in party-related activities. Some of the authors are relatively well known, like journalist Carl Bernstein and '60s activist Bettina Aptheker; however, most are noncelebrity children of rank-and-file party workers. They address several subjects, including patterns of life within their families, the impact of political persecution, and the ways they've dealt with their political heritage. The contributors "look back on their childhoods [the editors note] with varying mixtures of nostalgia, pride, confusion, anger, and pain" --as would almost any other grouping of nearly 50 memoirists. Yet the collection reflects some commonalities of experience; particularly, strong political and historical awareness, "an oppositional identity," and conviction that, together, individuals can accomplish change. <i>Mary Carroll</i>&#34;Runs the gamut, chronicling childhoods loved and hated, parents revered and feared, politics embraced and avoided. The book&#39;s 46 essays are lively and heartfelt. The mix brings forth an intensely moving collection of American histories.&#34; -- Eleanor J.

St. Anthony Messenger</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Roaring Lambs: A Gentle Plan to Radically Change Your World</h2><p>Where have all the Christians gone?<br>Bob Briner believes evangelical Christian thought, ideas, and ideals are not shaping American society. In fact, he feels solid Christian thinking seldom is part of the important discussions and debates of our culture. There's very little "salt" in the popular press, almost none on television, only a grain or two in modern literature and the visual arts, and barely a dash in movies. In the culture-shaping arenas of our society - those areas that influence how we think and act - Christians have abdicated their role as salt and light.<br>Is this just the way it's supposed to be? Should Christians be content with a society that glorifies the profane and welcomes the immoral? "No way," says Briner. His book is a call for Christians to become "roaring lambs" - men and women who believe the Christian faith is relevant to all the problems faced by modern man and who still act on that conviction.<br>Briner believes it's wrong to criticize Hollywood, the press, television, the arts, and the publishing business for the immoral and irreverent views they espouse. Without Christians working shoulder to shoulder with these "culture shapers," how can we expect them to accept and promote Judeo-Christian values? Instead of protests and boycotts, the way to clean up these industries is to join them. Christian writers need to write decent novels to replace the trashy ones. Christian filmmakers and supporting investors need to make wholesome, honorable movies to compete against the filth that comes out of Hollywood. And for those who may never be in a position to "roar" at this level, we can all encourage our children to pursue careers that will enable them to help shape culture.<br>This book is more than a critique of Christian influence in the world. It is a strategy for re-entering the world for God and His Kingdom. Using personal anecdotes from his own experience as an Emmy-award-winning roaring lamb, the author will offer ways for Christians to jump back into the fray. He will show that you don't have to be the CEO of Warner Bros. to be a roaring lamb; you just need to begin believing that Christian faith and teaching belong in every arena of public discourse.<br>Read the book, then clear your throat. It's time for the lambs to roar!</p><p>Bob Briner is the president of ProServ Television and the author of The Management Methods of Jesus, Roaring Lambs and Lambs Among Wolves.

Just in time for Star Wars: Episode III, the wildly gifted mind of the Lucasfilm art department and visual effects powerhouse Industrial Light &amp; Magic come together to tell their own Star Wars tales in this compilation of short stories. Given free reign to explore any and every aspect of the Star Wars universe, each artist offers a new twist or a deeper view into that galaxy far, far away. Nowhere else will you find a more pure or more different look at George Lucas's enduring creation than through the eyes of the Star Wars: Visionaries.</p><p>The creators behind Star Wars: Visionaries all work for Lucasfilm and / or Industrial Light and Magic as concept artists, and have all been involved in work on the three recent Star Wars movies: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Episode II - Attack of the Clones, and the forthcoming Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.Grade 10 Up&#x2013;In the introduction to this collection, J. W. Rinzler writes about the weekly Friday meetings with writer/director George Lucas and the concept artists of the movie <i>The Revenge of the Sith</i>. In those preproduction meetings, Lucas would toss around ideas and the artists would come up with visual representations. Although Lucas liked many of the concepts, he did not believe that all of them fit into his movie, so 10 of the artists use these pages to show off their styles and imaginative <i>Star Wars</i> scenarios, providing readers with intimate views by some of the key creators of a galaxy far, far away. The artists were given free reign to explore all aspects of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe; each tale offers a glimpse into or new twist on that galaxy. The emphasis is on art and character origins. The graphics range from gothic-looking watercolors to bright and dazzling paintings. The book is in full color, but there is a tendency toward dark, muddy hues and bright red highlights. Not just for fans of the movies, this compilation is an excellent resource for readers interested in how ideas, artwork, and printed material come together.<i>&#x2013;Erin Dennington, Fairfax County Public Library, Chantilly, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For better or worse, this happens in Paul Campos' (<i>Jurismania</i>) book <i>The Obesity Myth</i>. Packed full of lengthy discussions of popular studies (particularly the Harvard nurses study), dense chapters run through statistics and conclusions at a breathtaking pace. Campos regularly insists on two points: BMI is basically meaningless, and a variety of media-based sources are contributing to an enormous industry that blends oversized portions with trendy, potentially harmful, diets. He grabs attention to the first claim with early assertions that by BMI standards, Brad Pitt is overweight and George Clooney is obese; more detailed discussion covers how insurance companies developed the BMI tables in their earliest forms and the federal government later tinkered with measurements in a way that accounts for much of the sudden "explosion" in obesity (yes, a BMI chart is included at the end of the book). Repeatedly, Campos rails against media stars whose main qualification is their leanness, questions medical conclusions, and demands that we look at weight as a class issue. Also highlighted is the idea of the diet industry being an extremely powerful political force, which may be at the root of the controversy; the hollering about his sources is likely to be louder than the comments about his accuracy in assessing those sources. As with any highly inflammatory topic, a single book presents only a part of the whole picture--but the myth-busting opinions offered here are an important part of the weight-based discussions. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>A professor of law at the University of Colorado and a nationally recognized expert on America�&#x2019;s war on fat, Paul Campos is the author of a weekly opinion column that appears in more than forty newspapers nationwide.

The party was in full swing and the free-form rhythms of the jazz&#x2014;the &#x201c;syncopated strut&#x201d; of the piano, the seductive siren call of the trumpet&#x2014;made conversation difficult.1 Sylvia, in Cambridge studying on a Fulbright Fellowship, had been drinking all night: a lethal line of &#x201c;red-gold&#x201d; Whisky Macs at a pub in town with her date for that night, Hamish Stewart. The potent combination of scotch and ginger wine had left her feeling like she could almost walk through the air.2 In fact, the alcohol had had the opposite effect; as she had been walking to the party she had found herself so inebriated that she had kept banging into trees.<br> <br>On arrival at the Women&#x2019;s Union&#x2014;the venue in Falcon Yard chosen to celebrate the first issue of the slim student-made literary journal the St. Botolph&#x2019;s Review&#x2014;Sylvia saw that the room was packed with young men in turtleneck sweaters and women in elegant black dresses. Counterpointing the jazz, the sound of poetry was in the air: great chunks of it being quoted back and forth like rallies in a game of literary dominance and seduction.<br> <br>Sylvia was in a bullish mood that night. One of the contributors to St. Botolph&#x2019;s Review, Daniel Huws, had sneered at two of her poems that had appeared in another Cambridge literary magazine, dismissing her work as too polished and well made. &#x201c;Quaint and electric artfulness,&#x201d; he had written in Broadsheet. &#x201c;My better half tells me &#x2018;Fraud, fraud,&#x2019; but I will not say so; who am I to know how beautiful she may be.&#x201d;3 Plath felt justifiably angry; after all, she had been writing for publication since the age of eight and she had already earned sizable sums for poems and short stories from Harper&#x2019;s, the Atlantic Monthly, Mademoiselle, and Seventeen. She walked up to Huws, a pale, freckle-faced undergraduate at Peterhouse, and said in a tone of &#x201c;friendly aggression,&#x201d;4 &#x201c;Is this the better or worse half?&#x201d;5 Huws, who later regarded the words as a &#x201c;fair retaliation&#x201d; for his &#x201c;facetious and wounding&#x201d; remarks, did not know quite how to respond.6 From Sylvia&#x2019;s point of view, Huws looked too boyish. She was equally as dismissive of the rest of the St. Botolph&#x2019;s set, describing Lucas Myers, who was studying at Downing College, as inebriated and wearing a &#x201c;satanic smile,&#x201d; and Than Minton, reading natural sciences at Trinity, as so small-framed you would have to sit down if you wanted to talk to him (in Plath&#x2019;s world a short man was about as useful and attractive as a homosexual).7<br> <br>By this point, Sylvia had knocked back another drink, emptying its contents into her mouth, down her hands, and onto the floor. She then tried to dance the twist with Myers and, although her movements may well have been less than smooth, her memory was razor sharp. As she danced, she proceeded to recite the whole of Myers&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;Fools Encountered,&#x201d; which she had read for the first time earlier that day in St. Botolph&#x2019;s Review.8 When the music came to a temporary halt, she saw out of the corner of her eye somebody approaching. It was the same &#x201c;hunky boy,&#x201d; the one who had been &#x201c;hunching&#x201d; around over women whom she had seen earlier.9 He introduced himself as Ted Hughes. She recalled the three poems he had published in St. Botolph&#x2019;s Review, and in an effort to dazzle him with her vivacity, she immediately began reciting segments of them to him. In retrospect, it&#x2019;s ironic that one of the poems she declaimed, &#x201c;Law in the Country of the Cats,&#x201d; addresses the violent, irrational sense of enmity and rivalry that can often exist between individuals, even strangers.10 On first meeting, the attraction between Hughes&#x2014;who had graduated from Cambridge in 1954 and had a job in London as a reader for the J. Arthur Rank film company&#x2014;and Plath was instant. But Sylvia sensed something else too. &#x201c;There is a panther stalks me down: / One day I&#x2019;ll have my death of him,&#x201d; she wrote in &#x201c;Pursuit,&#x201d; a poem that she composed two days later.11<br> <br>Plath recorded this encounter&#x2014;now one of the most famous in all literary history&#x2014;in her journal the next day. Suffering from a terrible hangover&#x2014;she joked she thought she might be suffering from the DTs&#x2014;she described the sexual tension that had flared up between them. After she had quoted some lines from his poem &#x201c;The Casualty,&#x201d; Hughes had shouted back over the music at her, in a voice that made her think he might be Polish, &#x201c;You like?&#x201d; Did she want brandy, he had asked. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she yelled back, at which point he led her into another room. Hughes slammed the door and started pouring her glassfuls of brandy, which Plath tried to drink, but she didn&#x2019;t manage to find her mouth.12 Almost immediately, they started discussing Huws&#x2019;s critique of her poetry. Hughes joked that his friend knew that Plath was beautiful, that she could take such criticism, and that he would never have attacked her had she been a &#x201c;cripple.&#x201d; He told her he had &#x201c;obligations&#x201d; in the next room&#x2014;in effect, another Cambridge student, named Shirley&#x2014;and that he was working in London and earning �10 a week. Then, suddenly, Hughes leaned toward her and kissed her &#x201c;bang smash on the mouth.&#x201d; As he did so he ripped the red hair band from her head and ravished her with such force that her silver earrings came unclipped from her ears. He moved down to kiss her neck, and Plath bit him &#x201c;long and hard&#x201d; on the cheek; when the couple emerged from the room, blood was pouring down his face.13 As Plath bit deep into his skin, she thought about the battle to the death that Hughes had described in &#x201c;Law in the Country of the Cats&#x201d; and the perpetrator&#x2019;s admission of the crime: &#x201c;I did it, I.&#x201d;14 Hughes carried the &#x201c;swelling ring-moat of tooth marks&#x201d; on his face for the next month or so, while he admitted that the encounter and the woman remained branded on his self &#x201c;for good.&#x201d;15<br> <br>Hughes left his mark on Plath and her reputation too. After her suicide, in February 1963, as her estranged, but not divorced, husband, he became Plath&#x2019;s literary executor, the guardian of her writings and, in effect, responsible for how she was perceived. A great deal has been written about the way Plath&#x2019;s posthumous journals were edited; since they were first published in abridged form in 1982, questions have been raised about Hughes&#x2019;s influence and motivation. At what point did editorializing (the understandable deletion of information because of repetition or legal problems) mutate into the altogether more sinister act of censorship? What part did he take in excising certain sensitive parts of the diaries? Why did he destroy one of the later journals? In his defense, he said he did so because he didn&#x2019;t want his children, Frieda and Nicholas, from his marriage with Plath, to read them. &#x201c;In those days,&#x201d; he claimed, he &#x201c;regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival.&#x201d;16<br> <br>Sylvia viewed Ted as something of a colossus, and to this day his enormous shadow obscures many aspects of Plath&#x2019;s life and work. The sensational aspects of the Plath-Hughes relationship (from that intense first meeting, through to their marriage only four months later, to the birth of their children, followed by Ted&#x2019;s infidelity, their separation, and then Sylvia&#x2019;s death at the age of thirty) have dominated the cultural landscape to such an extent that their story has taken on the resonance of a modern myth. In addition, Hughes&#x2019;s determination to market Ariel&#x2014;a volume of poetry that was published in 1965, three years after Plath&#x2019;s death&#x2014;as the crowning glory of her poetical career has caused her other work to be marginalized. In Hughes&#x2019;s view, the poetry she wrote toward the end of her life was the most important; anything that came before was a mere dress rehearsal. Stories, letters, journal entries, poems&#x2014;hundreds of them&#x2014;were nothing more than &#x201c;impurities,&#x201d; &#x201c;by-products&#x201d; of a process of transformation.17 Hughes cited the backstory of Shakespeare&#x2019;s The Tempest to draw an analogy between Plath&#x2019;s long-imprisoned creative talent and its sudden liberation during the writing of the Ariel collection. Her poetry, he said, was the &#x201c;biology&#x201d; of Ariel, the backstory of the airy spirit who was once trapped in the pine until she was set free by Prospero.18<br> <br>The implication is clear. Plath, as a poet (perhaps even as a woman), did not exist&#x2014;so the argument goes&#x2014;before she created these late poems. During the process of crafting them, she finally becomes, in the words of Robert Lowell, who wrote the introduction to the American edition of Ariel (published in 1966), &#x201c;herself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lowell&#x2019;s essay set the tone for Plath studies for the rest of the twentieth century. In writing Ariel, Plath &#x201c;becomes something imaginary, newly, wildly and subtly created&#x2014;hardly a person at all, or a woman, certainly not another &#x2018;poetess,&#x2019; but one of those super-real, hypnotic, great classical heroines&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The voice is now coolly amused, witty, now sour, now fanciful, girlish, charming, now sinking to the strident rasp of the vampire&#x2014;a Dido, Phaedra, or Medea.&#x201d; The work is distinct because of its &#x201c;controlled hallucination, the autobiography of a fever. She burns to be on the move, a walk, a ride, a journey, the flight of the queen bee. She is driven forward by the pounding pistons of her heart&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She herself is a little like a racehorse [the collection&#x2019;s title is a reference to the name of a horse Plath used to ride], galloping relentlessly with risked, outstretched neck, death hurdle after death hurdle topped&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Suicide, father-hatred, self-loathing&#x2014;nothing is too much for the macabre gaiety of her control. Yet it is too much; her art&#x2019;s immortality is life&#x2019;s disintegration.&#x201d;19<br> <br>It is one thing for Hughes to argue that the writing that came before Ariel was a product of Plath&#x2019;s &#x201c;lesser and artificial selves&#x201d;20 and quite another to believe that her &#x201c;mature&#x201d; work only began in 1956. Yet in his introduction to Plath&#x2019;s Collected Poems, this is the date that Hughes gives as the year in which Plath started to move away from the &#x201c;juvenilia&#x201d; he associates with her early years. It also happens to be the year in which the couple met.<br> <br>Hughes, in his role of editor, chose to confine a selection of fifty poems written before 1956 to a small section at the end of the volume, a gesture that almost feels like an apology or an afterthought. Defending his decision, Hughes said that Plath, had she lived, would have rejected these poems. Yet in the same paragraph, he added a number of reasons why he decided to include fifty of them in the Collected Poems. At their very best, he said, they possessed a lyrical quality that rivaled the poems she wrote later in life. They also showed, he added, traces of the &#x201c;super-charged system of inner symbols and images,&#x201d; that made up her creative universe.21 In the end, Hughes, like all editors, had to make a value judgment and selected what he thought were Plath&#x2019;s &#x201c;best&#x201d; early poems. Yet for those &#x201c;specialists&#x201d; who really wanted to investigate the links between her late and early work, he said he would accompany the &#x201c;juvenilia&#x201d; with a list of poems, arranged alphabetically, of all the poems she wrote before 1956.22<br> <br>There is only one problem: the list is far from complete. One of the missing poems is her 1953 villanelle &#x201c;Mad Girl&#x2019;s Love Song,&#x201d; which Plath described as one of her favorites.23 The poem is written from the perspective of a young woman who is waiting for her date to turn up. When she closes her eyes, the &#x201c;world drops dead&#x201d; and she is forced to question whether her lover is real or a projected fantasy. Has she really just made him up inside her head, she asks herself. The form of the villanelle&#x2014;the repetition of the first and third lines of the first stanza&#x2014;lends itself to the peculiar intensity of the poem&#x2019;s emotional content. The refrains echo throughout the poem like obsessional thoughts that refuse to be dispersed by the reality of the world around her. The mad girl of the title suffers from a double solipsism, imprisoned both within the boundaries of herself (when she shuts her eyes, the world simply disappears; when she opens them again, external reality is restored) and the confines of her feelings for her absent lover. In her journal, she recalled how she had been inspired to write the poem after a boyfriend, &#x201c;Mike,&#x201d; didn&#x2019;t turn up for a date.24<br> <br>The Mike she refers to is Myron Lotz, one of a myriad of Plath&#x2019;s early boyfriends who, over the years, have been obscured by the &#x201c;dark, hunky&#x201d; presence of Ted Hughes. Yet these men&#x2014;figures who have not been explored in any depth in any previous biography&#x2014;influenced and shaped both Plath&#x2019;s life and her work in a way that has not been fully appreciated. Although Hughes was &#x201c;her husband&#x201d; (as he once described himself in the third person),25 he was not the only man in her life: before she met him she had gone out with literally hundreds of men&#x2014;some who were innocent dates, others who were more serious. As she said herself in an early poem, &#x201c;Adolescence,&#x201d; she knew she would never be able to confine her love to just one man.26 These men inspired both her poetry&#x2014;for instance, Gordon Lameyer, who was unofficially engaged to Plath in August 1954, was the source of &#x201c;Sonnet for a Green-Eyed Sailor&#x201d;&#x2014;and her prose: she regurgitated her toxic feelings for boyfriend Dick Norton by penning a vicious portrait of him as the unimaginative Buddy Willard in her autobiographical novel The Bell Jar.<br> <br>Dick Norton (whom Plath dated between 1951 and 1953) became a symbol of everything Plath hated about the American hypocritical attitude toward sex. In an unpublished letter she wrote to her friend Ann Davidow in January 1952, Plath talks of her anger at learning that Dick was not a virgin (after pretending he had been). In the letter, she outlines how she did not object from a moral point of view but because she wished she could have enjoyed the same pleasures herself.27 Plath was an addict of experience, and she could not bear the fact that young women like her were denied something so life-enhancing. In the same letter she goes on to write of her deep envy of males, anger she describes as &#x201c;insidious, malignant, latent.&#x201d;28<br> <br>Sex&#x2014;or rather the constraints and repressions surrounding it&#x2014;played a central role in Plath&#x2019;s creative and psychological development. She realized, as she wrote in her journal in the autumn of 1950, she was too well brought up to disregard tradition, yet she hated boys who could express themselves sexually while she had no choice but to &#x201c;drag&#x201d; herself from one date to the next in &#x201c;soggy desire.&#x201d; The system, she added, disgusted her.29<br> <br>If too much has been made of the symptoms of Plath&#x2019;s mental illness, so too little attention has been paid to its possible causes. Sylvia Plath was an angry young woman born in a country and at a time that only exacerbated and intensified her f...</p><h2>Art of The Boot</h2><p>Since the publication of THE COWBOY BOOT in 1992, the art of the boot has risen unbelievably.

Reprint. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Almost completely ignored by the mainstream press during his lifetime, <b>H. P. Lovecraft</b>&nbsp;has since come to be recognized as one of the greatest writers of classic horror, on a par with Edgar Allan Poe, Lovecraft's mentor. H. P. Lovecraft's work has been translated into more than a dozen languages, his tales adapted for film, television, and comic books, and he has been the subject of more scholarly study than any other writer of horror fiction save Poe.</p><h2>Runner (Sam Dryden)</h2><p><p>Sam Dryden, retired special forces, lives a quiet life in a small town on the coast of Southern California. While out on a run in the middle of the night, a young girl runs into him on the seaside boardwalk. Barefoot and terrified, she's running from a group of heavily armed men with one clear goal&#x2015;to kill the fleeing child. After Dryden helps her evade her pursuers, he learns that the eleven year old, for as long as she can remember, has been kept in a secret prison by forces within the government. But she doesn't know much beyond her own name, Rachel. She only remembers the past two months of her life&#x2015;and that she has a skill that makes her very dangerous to these men and the hidden men in charge.</p><p>Dryden, who lost his wife and young daughter in an accident five years ago, agrees to help her try to unravel her own past and make sense of it, to protect her from the people who are moving heaven and earth to find them both. Although Dryden is only one man, he's a man with the extraordinary skills and experience&#x2015;as a Ranger, a Delta, and five years doing off-the-book black ops with an elite team. But, as he slowly begins to discover, the highly trained paramilitary forces on their heels is the only part of the danger they must face. Will Rachel's own unremembered past be the most deadly of them all?</p></p><p>PATRICK LEE lives in Michigan. He is the author of three previous novels: <i>The Breach </i>(a <i>New York Times Bestseller</i>), <i>Ghost Country</i>, and <i>Deep Sky</i>.CHAPTER ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Just after three in the morning, Sam Dryden surrendered the night to insomnia and went running on the boardwalk. Cool humidity clung to him and filtered the lights of El Sedero to his left, the town sliding past like a tanker in the fog. To his right was the Pacific, black and silent as the edge of the world tonight. His footfalls on the old wood came back to him from every part of the darkness. <br>It was just as well not to sleep. Sleep brought dreams of happier times, worse than nightmares in their own way. <br>Mercury lights over the boardwalk shone down into the mist. They snaked away in a chain to the south, the farthest all but lost in the gloom where the boardwalk terminated at the channel. Dryden passed the occasional campfire on the beach and caught fragments of conversations amplified in the fog. Soft voices, laughter, huddled silhouettes haloed by firelight. Shutter glimpses of what life could be. Dryden felt like an intruder, seeing them. Like a ghost passing them in the dark. <br>These nighttime runs were a new thing, though he&#x2019;d lived in El Sedero for years. He&#x2019;d started taking them a few weeks before, at all hours of the night. They came on like fits&#x2014;compulsions he wasn&#x2019;t sure he could fight. He hadn&#x2019;t tried to, so far. He found the exertion and the cold air refreshing, if not quite enjoyable. No doubt the exercise was good for him, too, though outwardly he didn&#x2019;t seem to need it. He was lean for his six-foot frame and looked at least no older than his thirty-six years. Maybe the jogs were just his mind&#x2019;s attempt to kick-start him from inertia. <br>Inertia. That was what a friend had called it, months ago. One of the few who still came around. Five years back, right after everything had happened, there had been lots of friends. They&#x2019;d been supportive when they were supposed to be, and later they&#x2019;d been insistent&#x2014;they&#x2019;d pushed him the way people did when they cared. Pushed him to start his life again. He&#x2019;d said he appreciated it, said they were right&#x2014;of course you had to move on after a while. He&#x2019;d agreed and nodded, and watched the way their eyes got sad when they understood he was only saying those things to make them stop talking. He hadn&#x2019;t tried to explain his side of it. Hadn&#x2019;t told them that missing someone could feel like a watch you&#x2019;d been assigned to stand. That it could feel like duty. <br>He passed the last of the fires. Here the beach beneath the walk became rocky and damp, the moisture catching the glow from each lamppost. The shore lay vacant for the next several hundred yards. A minute later, in the middle of the dead stretch, Dryden came to an intersection in the boardwalk; a second branch led away inland. <br>He slowed and stopped. He almost always did, at this spot. He wasn&#x2019;t sure what drew him to it&#x2014;maybe just the emptiness of it. The junction lay in the darkness between lights, and there was never anyone around. Nights like this, with no moon and no surf, this place was the equivalent of a sensory deprivation chamber. <br>He leaned on the wooden rail with his elbows, facing the sea. As his breathing slowed, faint sounds finally came to him. The hiss of tires on the freeway, a mile inland beyond the dunes. Tiny animals moving in the beach grass behind the walk. Dryden had been standing there for over a minute when he heard another sound: running footsteps on the boardwalk&#x2019;s planking. <br>For a moment he thought it was another jogger. Then he knew otherwise&#x2014;the cadence was too fast. This was someone sprinting full-out. In the saturated air, the sound&#x2019;s origin was hard to trace. He looked left and then right along the shoreline stretch of the walk, but against the light glow he saw nobody coming. He was just stepping back from the rail, turning to look down the inland route, when the sprinting figure crashed into him from that direction. <br>He heard a gasp&#x2014;the voice of a young girl. Instantly she was fighting, pushing back from him in a panic, already turning to bolt away along the shoreline course. <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Dryden said. &#x201c;Are you alright?&#x201d; <br>She stopped and faced him. Even in the faint light, Dryden could see that she was terrified of something. She regarded him with nothing but caution and kept herself balanced to sprint again, though she seemed too out of breath to go much farther. She wore jeans and a T-shirt but no shoes or socks. Her hair&#x2014;dark brown, hanging below her shoulders&#x2014;was clean but uncombed. The girl could not have been more than twelve. For the briefest moment her eyes intensified; Dryden could see the calculation going on behind them. <br>Just like that, her defensive posture changed. She remained afraid, but not of him. She turned her gaze inland instead, back the way she&#x2019;d come from, and scrutinized the darkness there. Dryden looked, too, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. The inland run of the boardwalk led to the harbor road, across which lay the dune ridge, shrouded in the thick night. All appeared calm and quiet. <br>&#x201c;You live near here?&#x201d; the girl asked. <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s after you?&#x201d; <br>She turned to him again and moved closer. <br>&#x201c;I need somewhere to hide,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you everything, but please get me out of here first.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you to the police station, kid, but I can&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not the police,&#x201d; she said, so abruptly that Dryden felt an impulse to turn and continue his jog. Whatever the girl was in trouble for, getting caught up in it was not going to improve his night. <br>Seeing his change of expression, she stepped forward fast and grabbed his hand, her eyes pleading. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not running from the police. It&#x2019;s not like that.&#x201d; <br>Her gaze snapped to the side again, in the same moment that Dryden sensed movement in his peripheral vision. He followed her stare, and for a moment couldn&#x2019;t make sense of what he saw. Somehow he could discern the shapes of the dunes now, invisible in the gloom only moments earlier. They were rimmed with a faint, shifting light. The girl&#x2019;s breathing trembled. <br>&#x201c;Yes or no,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait any longer.&#x201d; <br>Dryden knew the sound of real terror in a person&#x2019;s voice. This girl wasn&#x2019;t afraid of getting busted for some misdemeanor; she was afraid for her life. <br>The light around the dunes sharpened, and Dryden suddenly understood what he was seeing: People with flashlights were about to crest the ridge from the far side. The urge to distance himself from the girl was gone, replaced by a sense that something was very wrong here, and that she wasn&#x2019;t lying. <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Dryden said. <br>Still holding her hand, he ran north along the boardwalk, back in the direction of his house. He had to slow his pace only slightly for her. As they ran, Dryden kept looking to the dunes. He and the girl had gone no more than fifty yards when the first sharp spike of light topped the ridge. Within seconds, three more appeared. He was surprised by how close they were; the night had been playing tricks on his sense of distance. <br>Directly ahead along the boardwalk, one of the overhead mercury lights was coming up fast. Dryden stopped, the girl almost pulling his arm off as she stopped with him. <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; she asked. She watched the pursuers as tensely as Dryden did. <br>He nodded to the cone of light on the boardwalk. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll see us if we run through the light.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t stay here,&#x201d; the girl said. <br>The men with flashlights&#x2014;six of them now&#x2014;were descending the face of the dune ridge at sprint speed. <br>Dryden looked over the rail on the ocean side of the boardwalk. The beach was only a few feet below. He gestured to it, and the girl understood. She slipped under the waist-high rail, and he followed, his feet touching down on the loose stones piled beneath the walk. Beyond the stones, the beach extended a hundred feet to the waterline, rocky but still mostly sand. Dryden knelt and touched the surface; it was smooth and flat, saturated by the mist, and bore not a footprint as far as he could see in the near-dark. If he and the girl made any move on the beach, the pursuers would easily spot their prints and follow. <br>He turned his attention to the space beneath the walk. It wasn&#x2019;t promising. The piled stones were volleyball sized; picking their way over them would be slow going, especially in the deep shadows there. Worse, support beams crisscrossed the space every few feet. They&#x2019;d make little progress before the men arrived, and certainly at least one of the six would drop to the beach to put some light under the boardwalk. As a hiding place, it was a dead giveaway. <br>Dryden looked up over the planking and saw the men reach the base of the dune. It was all happening too quickly. In the still night he heard their running footsteps on the asphalt of the harbor road, and then on the wood of the inland boardwalk stretch. In less than thirty seconds, they would reach the rail above this very spot. <br>Dryden looked at the cross bracing under the walk and saw the only solution available. He guided the girl underneath. She was shaking but seemed relieved to be getting out of sight. Below the surface planks, heavy beams ran lengthwise along the walkway. These were in turn supported by far thicker beams, running sideways like the planking. Above these lower beams were gaps, not big enough for a person to fit into, but big enough for a pair of feet or hands. <br>&#x201c;Hold on to me,&#x201d; Dryden said, and pulled the girl against his chest. She complied without hesitating; the footsteps of the approaching men began to shake the boardwalk. <br>With the girl hugging tight against him, Dryden reached up and grabbed one of the lower beams with his fingertips&#x2014;it was far too big to get his hands around&#x2014;and then swung his feet up and hooked them into the gap above the next beam, five feet away. He made a hammock of himself, with the girl atop him, and pulled himself as tightly against the underside of the boardwalk as he could. It was like doing a push-up in reverse. <br>It was immediately clear he could not hold this position for long. Everything about it was wrong. His fingertips had no traction on the giant beam, requiring him to apply pressure to hang on. The muscles in his forearms were burning within seconds. At the same time, keeping his body straight involved contracting half of his muscles in ways they weren&#x2019;t meant to be used. <br>The girl seemed to understand, perhaps feeling his muscle tremors. As the footsteps thundered toward them, she put her mouth to his ear and whispered, &#x201c;They have guns. They&#x2019;ll kill us.&#x201d; <br>A moment later, the gaps in the boardwalk above filled with flashlight glare. The men had reached the shoreline stretch of the walk and had begun to fan out along it. <br>One of them spoke, his voice ringing clear and strong. It sounded like a voice accustomed to giving orders. <br>&#x201c;Search the beach. Search beneath the causeway.&#x201d; <br>Boots scuffed the wood, then landed hard on the rocks nearby. The glow of the flashlights filled Dryden&#x2019;s peripheral vision, though for the moment the beams remained pointed toward the sea. The girl hugged him tighter; he thought he could feel her shutting her eyes as she buried her face in his shoulder. The pain in his muscles was beyond burning now, but pain wasn&#x2019;t the problem. There were ways to disregard agony&#x2014;Dryden had learned them long ago&#x2014;but at some point his muscles would simply fail. Willpower couldn&#x2019;t beat physics forever. <br>He managed to swivel his head a few degrees toward the beach. The flashlight beams finished sweeping the sand, and then one by one they turned to scour the space beneath the boardwalk. Dryden looked upward again, to prevent his eyes from shining. Staring at the planking above his face, he saw the diffused glow as beams passed directly beneath him. If even one of the searchers was clever or suspicious enough to raise his light by two feet, it would all be over. Dryden waited for the blinding glare that would signal that very thing. <br>It never came. <br>The vague wash of light subsided. Darkness. Dryden counted to ten and risked another glance at the beach. The searchers had moved on to the north, inspecting the boardwalk as they went. It was time to swing down and try for a quiet getaway, whatever the risk. Every moment he delayed increased the chance that hed simply fall, which would be anything but quiet. He was starting to slide his feet out of the gap when a sound stopped him. <br>Footsteps. Heavy and slow, on the boardwalk above. They approached from the south, the direction the searchers had come from. Dryden remained frozen. The man on the boardwalk stopped directly above him; traces of sand fell in Dryden&#x2019;s face. <br>&#x201c;Clay,&#x201d; the man called out. It was the leader. The guy with the voice. He&#x2019;d remained on the boardwalk while the others searched. <br>One of the men on the beach, Clay apparently, turned and approached, his flashlight playing haphazardly over the ground. He stopped at the edge of the boardwalk, looking up at the leader. Had he lowered his gaze and looked straight ahead, he would have locked eyes with Dryden, no more than eighteen inches away. Dryden dared not even turn his head upward again; the slightest movement could give him up. He hoped the shuddering of his muscles didn&#x2019;t show as intensely as it felt. <br>Of Clay&#x2019;s features, Dryden could see almost nothing. The man was barely a silhouette against the black ocean and sky. Only the backscatter glow from the flashlight beam offered any detail: medium-length hair, dark clothing, a weapon hanging at his side by a shoulder strap. A submachine gun&#x2014;something like an MP-5 with a heavy sound suppressor. <br>Above, on the boardwalk, the leader said, &#x201c;This is out of hand already. Go back to the van, set up coverage of police channels in a twenty-mile radius. Call Chernin, get him working on personal cell phones of officers and whatever federal agents are based in the area. Gold-pan the audio for keywords like <i>girl</i> and <i>lost</i>. Try <i>psych ward</i> while you&#x2019;re at it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think if she talks to anybody,&#x201d; Clay said, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ll think she walked out of a mental hospital?&#x201d; <br>Dryden suddenly felt his fingertips slipping from their hold on the fog-dampened wood. No amount of exertion could stop it; he was going to lose his grip in a matter of seconds. <br>&#x201c;Solid chance of it,&#x201d; the leader said. <br>Dryden&#x2019;s fingertips held by a quarter inch. He felt that margin shrink by half in the span of a breath. <br>&#x201c;And if we lose the trail anyway?&#x201d; Clay asked. <br>For a second the leader didn&#x2019;t answer. Then he said, &#x201c;Either she gets buried in the gravel pits, or we do.&#x201d; <br>Dryden tensed for the fall, trying to imagine any way he could get on his feet and escape with the girl. <br>At that instant he felt her move. Without a sound, she took her arms from around his chest, reached past his head to the beam, and clamped her hands as tightly as she could over his fingertips. The minor force she could apply was enough to make the difference; his grip held. <br>Above the clamor of thoughts demanding Dryden&#x2019;s attention, one briefly took precedence: <i>How the hell had she known?</i> <br>A second later Clay pocketed his flashlight, climbed onto the boardwalk, and ran off in the direction the group had come from. Dryden waited for the leader to move off as well, but for a moment he only stood there, his breath audible in the darkness. Then he turned and thudded away to the north, following the searchers. When his footsteps had grown faint, Dryden at last slipped his feet from the beam and swung down. Blood surged into his muscles like ice water. The girl got her balance on the rocks and leaned past him to look up the beach. Dryden looked, too: The searchers were a hundred yards away. <br>The girl sniffled. Dryden realized she was crying. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she whispered. Her voice cracked on the first ...</p><h2>Those in Peril (Hector Cross)</h2><p><p>THE <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</p><p>Hazel Bannock is heir to the Bannock Oil Corporation, one of the major global oil producers.

A high school math genius, he&#x2019;s secretly fascinated with a series of children&#x2019;s fantasy novels set in a magical land called Fillory, and real life is disappointing by comparison. When Quentin is unexpectedly admitted to an elite, secret college of magic, it looks like his wildest dreams have come true. But his newfound powers lead him down a rabbit hole of hedonism and disillusionment, and ultimately to the dark secret behind the story of Fillory. The land of his childhood fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he ever could have imagined. . . .<br><br>The prequel to the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling book <i>The Magician King </i>and the #1 bestseller&nbsp;<i>The Magician's Land</i>, <i>The Magicians</i> is one of the most daring and inventive works of literary fantasy in years. No one who has escaped into the worlds of Narnia and Harry Potter should miss this breathtaking return to the landscape of the imagination.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, August 2009</strong>: Mixing the magic of beloved children's fantasy classics (from <em>Narnia</em> and <em>Oz</em> to <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Earthsea</em>) with the sex, excess, angst, and anticlimax of life in college and beyond, Lev Grossman's <em>Magicians</em> reimagines modern-day fantasy for grownups. Quentin Coldwater lives in a state of perpetual melancholy, privately obsessed with his childhood books about the enchanted land of Fillory. When he&#x2019;s admitted to the surreptitious Brakebills Academy for an education in magic, Quentin finds mastering spells is tedious (and love is even more fraught). He also discovers his power has thrilling potential--though it's unclear what he should do with it once he's moved with his new magician cohorts to New York City. Then they discover the magical land of Fillory is real and launch an expedition to use their powers to set things right in the kingdom--which, naturally, turns out to be a much murkier proposition than expected. <em>The Magicians</em> breathes life into a cast of characters you want to know--if the people you want to know are charismatic, brilliant, complex, flawed magicians--and does what Quentin claims books never really manage to do: "get you out, really out, of where you were and into somewhere better.

Numerous critics have accused Pius of everything from deliberate anti-Semitism to collusion with the Nazi regime, while equally partisan defenders have argued that his silent diplomacy saved hundreds of thousands of Jews and other innocent victims from Nazi terror. So contentious has Pius&#39; role become that the phrase the silence of Pius XII has taken on a life of its own, beyond the facts.</p><p>Jos� M. S�nchez is professor of history at Saint Louis University. He is the author of several works, including &#34;The Spanish Civil War as a Religious Tragedy.&#34;After the hype associated with John Cornwell's 1999 work Hitler's Pope, this careful, scholarly study of Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust is a refreshing contribution to a debate that continues more than a half century after the end of World War II. Sanchez, a professor of history at St. Louis University, thoughtfully examines the various arguments on both sides of a controversy that will likely never be resolved. In doing so, he presents a dispassionate, thoroughly documented tome that exhibits a high degree of fairness. Sanchez began his research in 1998 to provide a fresh, balanced look at a topic on which most authors have found it necessary to weigh in heavily on one side or the other. He assesses claims ranging from allegations that the late pope was an anti-Semite to the defense that the pontiff did not speak out more forcefully against the Nazi persecution of the Jews because he feared he would make things worse for the victims. Sanchez's conclusions offer nods to both the critics and defenders of Pius XII, but because his summary statement is more gray than black or white, readers looking for the sort of spice dished up by Hitler's Pope will doubtless be left disappointed.

In 1995, Dr. Agatston developed the South Beach Diet to help his cardiac and diabetes patients improve their blood chemistries and lose weight. Since then, his book <i>The South Beach Diet</i> and its companion titles have sold more than 22 million copies. Dr. Agatston has published more than 100 scientific articles and abstracts in medical journals, and recently he received the prestigious Alpha Omega Award from New York University Medical Center for outstanding achievement in the medical profession. He lives in Miami Beach with his wife, Sari.Healthy Entertaining on the South Beach Diet You may think that you have to shop and cook differently than you usually do on the South Beach Diet in order to throw a memorable party. But just the opposite is true. As you prepare the recipes in this book, you&#39;ll realize that making dishes for special occasions means using the same nutritious ingredients that you choose on a day-to-day basis. From tantalizing appetizers to sumptuous desserts, you&#39;ll be producing fantastic, healthy meals that will remain in your entertaining repertoire for years to come. In fact, if you love to cook classic dishes for festive occasions, you&#39;ll find yourself continually turning to this book. Our Christmas Day menu, for example, features a mouthwatering Crown Roast of Pork served with Apple- Onion Chutney, tender Braised Red Cabbage, and nutty Green Beans Amandine (see pages 217 to 231). Our healthy Easter menu puts a lemony Spring Quinoa Salad alongside a traditional Herb and Garlic Roasted Leg of Lamb (see pages 145 to 153). And for the Fourth of July, there are fantastic Firecracker Cheddar Burgers (page 179) made with lean ground beef and reduced-fat cheese. And who could throw a Super Bowl party without a great chili or have Thanksgiving without turkey, stuffing, and pumpkin pie? We&#39;ve updated these must-haves without ever compromising taste. So, when you host your South Beach Diet Super Bowl Bash, you&#39;ll serve a hearty Pork and Poblano Chili (page 56) made with a lean cut of meat and loads of nutritious, fiber-rich vegetables and beans. And for Thanksgiving, you&#39;ll make a Pumpkin Pie (page 194) that has all the creamy sweetness and spice you&#39;d expect, plus a delicate, buttery-tasting phyllo crust in place of one made with white flour, sugar, and butter. We&#39;ve also included plenty of dishes in every menu for vegetarian guests, as well as recipes that will appeal to kids. And to complement some of the meals, we&#39;ve come up with some unique mocktails-thirst-quenching, nonalcoholic drinks like Pomegranate Punch (page 123) and Mint-Ginger Spritzers (page 153)-that can be used interchangeably from one party to another. Finally, no party or holiday meal would be complete without dessert: Your guests expect it, and of course you&#39;ll want to enjoy a few bites yourself. For this reason, we&#39;ve continued to use the healthiest ingredients to make all the desserts in this book. We&#39;ve included old favorites, like a warm Blueberry Cobbler (page 87) for our Backyard Grill Fest, as well as new ideas like refreshing Lemon-Thyme Ices (page 175) for Mother&#39;s Day and some adorable mini Boy or Girl Angel Cakes (page 41) that are perfect for a baby shower. Bottom line: By using the healthy foods and cooking techniques we recommend throughout this book, you will be able to enjoy your South Beach Diet lifestyle at any party you throw. And as an added bonus, you&#39;ll feel better knowing that you&#39;re staying healthy. How to Use This Book Before you jump in and start cooking, there are a few things we want you to know about the organization of this book and its special features. We&#39;ve divided the book into two main sections. The first part features 10 festive parties, ranging from a Phase 1 Kickoff to celebrate your new lifestyle (and ideally help some friends start the diet, too) to a Rite of Passage Party to ring in a milestone event. Some of the parties are seasonal, like the Super Bowl Bash, and others, like the Family Buffet, can be held at anytime of the year. Many of the parties can easily be adapted to suit a wide variety of occasions. For example, you can host the Hors d&#39;Oeuvres for a Crowd party to celebrate a new job or an engagement or throw the Backyard Grill Fest or Weekend Brunch for a birthday or graduation party. The Baby Shower can be easily modified to fit a wedding shower. The second part of the book features 11 holidays that fall throughout the year, from New Year&#39;s Day to Christmas Day. We&#39;ve included traditional occasions, such as Passover, Easter, Cinco de Mayo, and Thanksgiving, as well as menus for other celebrations like Valentine&#39;s Day and Mother&#39;s Day. On the opening page for each party and holiday, you&#39;ll find a Game Plan-a quick reference tool that helps you get and stay organized. It lets you see at a glance which dishes can be prepared ahead and reminds you when to order special items in advance, like the crown roast of pork for Christmas. The Game Plans start as early as a month ahead (when certain dishes can be prepared and frozen) and lead you right up to what has to be done on the day of the party. Remember that you don&#39;t have to follow the Game Plans or the full menu for any event. Set up a schedule that works best for you, and leave out a soup course or an appetizer if time is tight or if you prefer to make less food. Each of the Game Plans works in tandem with the Make-Ahead instructions that appear beneath most of the recipes in this book. If you&#39;re following all or part of the Game Plan, you&#39;ll want to look to the Make-Ahead information for specific details. For example, if you choose to prepare the Chicken Cassoulet (page 73) ahead of time for the French Bistro Party, you&#39;ll turn to its Make-Ahead information for instructions on how to store the dish once it&#39;s cooked and how to reheat it on party day. And to help you plan ahead even further, we&#39;ve also provided prep and cook times with each recipe. While many of the recipes can be done on the day of the party, others may involve freezing or overnight marinating or a special technique that might require a little extra effort. You&#39;ll want to pay attention to these times as you plan your menus. In addition, each recipe is marked with the appropriate phase. If you&#39;re on Phase 1 and want to throw one of the parties that include Phase 2 and Phase 3 dishes, you can substitute Phase 1 dishes from other menus to create your own Phase 1 party. Of course, if you&#39;re on Phase 2 or Phase 3, you can prepare the Phase 1 recipes anytime. Following each recipe, you&#39;ll find &#34;Nutrition at a Glance.&#34; This breakdown will give you the calories, total fat and saturated fat, protein, carbohydrate, cholesterol, and fiber in an individual serving, and it can also help you keep track of sodium, if it&#39;s a concern. Remember, this is a special-occasion cookbook, so you&#39;ll intentionally be preparing more food than you normally do for an average meal on an average day. In fact, many of the recipes do provide seconds for those guests who might want an extra serving. And some menus may feature more than one entr�e or more than one dessert so you can easily feed a crowd. For every recipe, we&#39;ve indicated the number of servings and serving sizes (for example, 3 canap�s, 1 cookie, 1 cup soup) where useful, to help guide you as you make these nutritious dishes. Planning a Great South Beach Diet Party From the time you make the decision to host a party to the moment you see your last guest out the door, there are all kinds of things to consider. (See our &#34;Checklist for Success&#34; on pages 8 and 9.) Each party you give will have its own special flair, but you&#39;ll find these general pointers useful, too. First decide what type of party you want to have and how many people you&#39;d like to include. Our parties and holidays range in size from 2 guests to 12, but you can easily scale them up or down for larger or smaller groups. Just double or triple the recipes to accommodate more people or cut the recipes by half if you invite fewer guests. Think about what kind of atmosphere your home has or what feeling you want to create. Will your party be formal or laid-back? Held indoors or out? Be an afternoon or an evening event? Choose a serving style. For example, the Rite of Passage Party and New Year&#39;s Day Open House work particularly well as buffet-style events. The Easter Gathering and Thanksgiving can be served family-style. And the Valentine&#39;s Day Dinner for 2 and Mother&#39;s Day Luncheon make more intimate meals. There&#39;s plenty of flexibility here, so decide what works best for you. Consider who&#39;s coming. Is your party just for adults, or will there be children invited, too? Our Fourth of July Revel and Family Buffet include a lot of kid-friendly food choices, while the French Bistro Party pleases more sophisticated palates. Pick a theme. Cinco de Mayo is a fun one to try. You can enhance the theme of a party like this by making maraca-shaped invitations, playing Mexican music, or having guests swing at a piñata. The Super Bowl Bash and Fourth of July Revel also make great theme-oriented occasions. Enjoying Party Day the South Beach Diet Way You&#39;ve planned, sent invites, shopped, and cooked. Now party day is finally here. You may be feeling a little stressed, but you don&#39;t have to be. The following suggestions can help you stay energized and worry-free before, during, and after the event. Don&#39;t change your normal eating routine. As mentioned earlier, on the days leading up to the party, and especially on the day of, stick to whatever phase of the diet you&#39;re on and make sure to eat breakfast, lunch, and healthy snacks. This way, you won&#39;t be hungry while you&#39;re preparing the party food, and when the party starts, you won&#39;t be -famished. Keep yourself hydrated. While you don&#39;t need to keep an exact count of how many glasses of water you consume on a daily basis, being well hydrated will help you stay energized and combat headaches and fatigue-two things you want to avoid on party day. Drink water when you feel thirsty and remember that fruits, vegetables, and milk contribute to your water intake. Schedule time for exercise. Getting some exercise decreases stress and increases energy. When you exercise, your body releases feel-good hormones called endorphins, which help relieve stress and keep your blood sugar levels stable so that you don&#39;t get cravings. If it&#39;s too hard to work in an aerobics, Pilates, or yoga class on party day, take a brisk walk or go for a bike ride or a swim. Enlist friends to help. We all have friends or family members who want to aid with party and holiday meals. Saying yes to a little assistance is a great way to reduce stress. Have your volunteers arrive early to prep a dish or two, arrange flowers, or get the table set. And when the party&#39;s over, commandeer some help for the cleanup, too. Enjoy some wine. If you like wine, have a glass once you&#39;ve had an hors d&#39;oeuvre or two or during your meal. Having food in your system when you drink slows the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream and helps keep your blood sugar levels steady. A glass or two of either red or white wine is fine. Avoid beer (except for the occasional light beer), high-sugar types of alcohol, such as apertifs and ice wines, and mixed drinks. Delight in dessert. Special occasions and dessert go hand in hand. If you like sweets, cut yourself a small piece of cake or select a cookie. Savor the dessert slowly, taking breaks between small bites. Or try the &#34;Three- Bite Rule&#34;: Take three bites and then put the dessert aside for a few minutes; most likely you won&#39;t come back to it. Do this often enough and you&#39;ll discover that just a few tastes of a great dessert can be very satisfying. Love the leftovers. The healthy leftovers you might have after a South Beach Diet party can be a blessing after all that cooking! Wrap extras in single portions to freeze and eat later in the week or wrap and send items home with your guests as a reminder of a great occasion. Now Think of Your Own Reasons to Celebrate! As this book shows, life itself offers an endless array of entertaining opportunities. But who really needs a special reason to celebrate when simply bringing friends and family together for a great meal can be reason enough? Turn to this cookbook again and again as you bring the many festivities of each year into your home. And, as each occasion arrives, savor every moment as you enjoy the healthy choices of your South Beach Diet lifestyle.</p><h2>Thunder &amp; Roses</h2><p>In return for helping her save her village, the Demon Earl demands that quiet schoolteacher Clare Morgan live with him for three months and let the world think the worst of their co-habitation. Original.</p><p>In the first novel in Penguin USA's new romance line, Putney ( Silk and Secrets ) offers fleshed-out characters but an overload of extraneous historical detail and a lame plot. Clare, a pious Methodist schoolteacher in a small Welsh village in 1814, agrees to live for three months with a wealthy man named Nicholas known as the "Demon Earl." Nicholas is the son of a nobleman and his gypsy wife who grew up spending some months of each year on the road with caravans and the rest of the year residing in his grandfather's sumptuous mansion. A part of the bargain is that he be allowed to kiss her once a day. Clare hopes that if she carries out her end of the deal Nicholas will see that the dangerous mine in town--in which several men have already lost their lives--is brought up to modern standards. There are also several subplots involving a friend of Nicholas's who has turned vengeful because of an imagined wrong done to him, and the rumor that Nicholas's grandfather died of a heart attack after barging in on his grandson in bed with the grandfather's second wife. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn</h2><p>Lucky and Bigman Jones try to intercept a spy&#39;s secret message, but are captured by their enemies, the Sirians, and held prisoner in a secret military base on Titan</p><p></p><h2>The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most revered works of fiction in the twentieth-century, <i>The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner </i>is a modern classic about integrity, courage, and bucking the system. Its title story recounts the story of a reform school cross-country runner who seizes the perfect opportunity to defy the authority that governs his life. It is a pure masterpiece. From there the collection expands even further from the touching &#x201c;On Saturday Afternoon&#x201d; to the rollicking &#x201c;The Decline and Fall and Frankie Buller.&#x201d; Beloved for its lean prose, unforgettable protagonists, and real-life wisdom,<i> The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</i> captured the voice of a generation, and its poignant and empowering life lessons will continue to captivate and entertain readers for generations to come.</p><p>Alan Sillitoe was born in 1928, the son of a tannery worker. He left school at age fourteen to work in a factory. He was one of the working-class novelists who revitalized British fiction in the 1950s. His first novel <i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</i> was followed with the bestselling collection <i>The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</i>. He adapted both works for the screen in the early 1960s. He is the author of more than 40 works of prose, poetry, and drama.As soon as I got to Borstal they made me a long-distance cross-country runner. I suppose they thought I was just the build for it because I was long and skinny for my age (and still am) and in any case I didn't mind it much, to tell you the truth, because running had always been made much of in our family, especially running away from the police. I've always been a good runner, quick and with a big stride as well, the only trouble being that no matter how fast I run, and I did a very fair lick even though I do say so myself, it didn't stop me getting caught by the cops after that bakery job.<br><br>You might think it a bit rare, having long-distance cross-country runners in Borstal, thinking that the first thing a long-distance cross-country runner would do when they set him loose at them fields and woods would be to run as far away from the place as he could get on a bellyful of Borstal slumgullion-but you're wrong, and I'll tell you why. The first thing is that them bastards over us aren't as daft as they most of the time look, and for another thing I'm not so daft as I would look if I tried to make a break for it on my long-distance running, because to abscond and then get caught is nothing but a mug's game, and I'm not falling for it. Cunning is what counts in this life, and even that you've got to use in the slyest way you can; I'm telling you straight: they're cunning, and I'm cunning. If only 'them' and 'us' had the same ideas we'd get on like a house on fire, but they don't see eye to eye with us and we don't see eye to eye with them, so that's how it stands and how it will always stand. The one fact is that all of us are cunning, and because of this there's no love lost between us. So the thing is that they know I won't try to get away from them: they sit there like spiders in that crumbly manor house, perched like jumped-up jackdaws on the roof, watching out over the drives and fields like German generals from the tops of tanks. And even when I jog-trot on behind a wood and they can't see me anymore they know my sweeping-brush head will bob along that hedge-top in an hour's time and that I'll report to the bloke on the gate. Because when on a raw and frosty morning I get up at five 0'clock and stand shivering my belly off on the stone floor and all the rest still have another hour to snooze before the bells go, I slink downstairs through all the corridors to the big outside door with a permit running-card in my :fist, I feel like the first and last man on the world, both at once, if you can believe what I'm trying to say. I feel like the first man because I've hardly got a stitch on and am sent against the frozen fields in a shimmy and shorts-even the first poor bastard dropped on to the earth in midwinter knew how to make a suit of leaves, or how to skin a pterodactyl for a topcoat. But there I am, frozen stiff, with nothing to get me warm except a couple of hours' long-distance running before breakfast, not even a slice of bread-and-sheepdip. They're training me up fine for the big sports day when all the pig-faced snotty-nosed dukes and ladies-who can't add two and two together and would mess themselves like loonies if they didn't have slavies to beck-and-call--come and make speeches to us about sports being just the thing to get us leading an honest life and keep our itching finger-ends off them shop locks and safe handles and hairgrips to open gas meters. They give us a bit of blue ribbon and a cup for a prize after we've shagged ourselves out running or jumping, like race horses, only we don't get so well looked-after as race horses, that's the only thing.<br><br>So there I am, standing in the doorway in shimmy and shorts, not even a dry crust in my guts, looking out at frosty flowers on the ground. I suppose you think this is enough to make me cry? Not likely. Just because I feel like the first bloke in the world wouldn't make me bawl. It makes me feel fifty times better than when I'm cooped up in that dormitory with three hundred others. No, it's sometimes when I stand there feeling like the last man in the world that I don't feel so good. I feel like the last man in the world because I think that all those three hundred sleepers behind me are dead. They sleep so well I think that every scruffy head's kicked the bucket in the night and I'm the only one left, and when I look out into the bushes and frozen ponds I have the feeling that it's going to get colder and colder until everything I can see, meaning my red arms as well, is going to be covered with a thousand miles of ice, all the earth, right up to the sky and over every bit of land and sea. So I try to kick this feeling out and act like I'm the first man on earth. And that makes me feel good, so as soon as I'm steamed up en9ugh to get this feeling in me, I take a flying leap out of the doorway, and off I trot.<br><br>I'm in Essex. It's supposed to be a good Borstal, at least that's what the governor said to me when I got here from Nottingham. u We want to trust you while you are in this establishment," he said, smoothing out his newspaper with lily-white workless hands, while I read the big words upside down: Daily Telegraph. "If you play ball with us, we'll play ball with you." (Honest to God, you'd have thought it was going to be one long tennis match.) H We want hard honest work and we want good athletics,'; he said as well. " And if you give us both these things you can be sure we'll do right by you and send you back into the world an honest man." Well, I could have died laughing, especially when straight after this I hear the barking sergeant-major's voice calling me and two others to attention and marching us off like we was Grenadier Guards. And when the governor kept saying how 4 we' wanted you to do this, and 4 we ' wanted you to do that, I kept looking round for the other blokes, wondering how many of them there was. Of course, I knew there were thousands of them, but as far as I knew only one was in the room. And there are thousands of them, all over the poxeaten country, in shops, offices, railway stations, cars, houses, pubs -In-law blokes like you and them, all on the watch for Outlaw blokes like me and us-and waiting to 'phone for the coppers as soon as we make a false move. And it'll always be there, I'll tell you that now, because I haven't finished making all my false moves yet, and I dare say I won't until I kick the bucket. If the In-laws are hoping to stop me making false moves they're wasting their time. They might as well stand me up against a wall and let fly with a dozen rifles. That's the only way they'll stop me, and a few million others. Because I've been doing a lot of thinking since coming here. They can spy on us all day to see if we're pulling our puddings and if we're working good or doing our 4 athletics' but they can't make an X-ray of our guts to find out what we're telling ourselves. I've been asking myself all sorts of questions, and thinking about my life up to now. And I like doing all this. It's a treat. It passes the time away and don't make Borstal seem half so bad as the boys in our street used to say it was. And this long-distance running lark is 'the best of all, because it makes me think so good that I learn things even better than when I'm on my bed at night. And apart from that, what with thinking so much while I'm running I'm getting to be one of the best runners in the Borstal. I can go my five miles round better than anybody else I know.<br><br>So as soon as I tell myself I'm the :first man ever to be dropped into the world, and as soon as I take that first flying leap out into the frosty grass of an early morning when even birds haven't the heart to whistle, I get to thinking, and that's what I like. I go my rounds in a dream, turning at lane or footpath corners without knowing I'm turning, leaping brooks without knowing they're there, and shouting good morning to the early cow-milker without seeing him. It's a treat, being a long-distance runner. out in the world by yourself with not a soul to make you bad-tempered or tell you what to do or that there's a shop to break and enter a bit back from the next street. Sometimes I think that I've never been so free as during that couple of hours when I'm trotting up the path out of the gates and turning by that bare-faced, big-bellied oak tree at the lane end. Everything's dead, but good, because it's dead before coming alive, not dead after being alive. That's how I look at it. Mind you, I often feel frozen stiff at first. I can't feel my hands or feet or flesh at all, like I'm a ghost who wouldn't know the earth was under him if he didn't see it now and again through the mist. But even though some people would call this frost-pain suffering if they wrote about it to their mams in a letter, I don't, because I know that in half an hour I'm going to be warm, that by the time I get to the main road and am turning on to the wheatfield footpath by the bus stop I'm going to feel as hot as a potbellied stove and as happy as a dog with a tin tail.<br><br>It's a good life, I'm saying to myself, if you don't give in to coppers and Borstal-bosses and the rest of them bastard-faced In-laws. Trot-trot-trot. Puff-puff-puff. Slap-slap-slap go my feet on the hard soil. Swish-swish-swish as my arms and side catch the bare branches of a bush. For I'm seventeen now, and when they let me out of this-if I don't make a break and see that things turn out otherwise-they'll try to get me in the army, and what's the difference between the army and this place I'm in now? They can't kid me, the bastards. I've seen the barracks near where I live, and if there weren't swaddies on guard outside with rifles you wouldn't know the difference between their high walls and the place I'm in now. Even though the swaddies come out at odd times a week for a pint of ale, so what? Don't I come out three mornings a week on my long-distance running, which is fifty times better than boozing. When they first said that I was to do my long-distance running without a guard pedalling beside me on a bike I couldn't believe it; but they called it a progressive and modern place, though they can't kid me because I know it's just like any other Borstal, going by the stories I've heard, except that they let me trot about like this. Borstal's Borstal no matter what they do; but anyway I moaned about it being a bit thick sending me out so early to run five miles on an empty stomach, until they talked me round to thinking it wasn't so bad-which I knew all the time-until they called me a good sport and patted me on the back when I said I'd do it and that I'd try to win them the Borstal Blue Ribbon Prize Cup For Long Distance Cross Country Running (All England). And now the governor talks to me when he comes on his rounds, almost as he'd talk to his prize race horse, if he had one.<br><br>All right, Smith? he asks.<br><br>" Yes, sir," I answer.<br><br>He flicks his grey moustache: How's the running coming along? "<br><br>I've set myself to trot round the grounds after dinner just to keep my hand in, sir," I tell him.<br><br>The pot-bellied pop-eyed bastard gets pleased at this: Good show. I know you'll get us that cup," he says.<br><br>And I swear under my breath: Like boggery, I will." No, I won't get them that cup, even though the stupid tash-twitching bastard has all his hopes in me. Because what does his barmy hope mean? I ask myself. Trot-trot-trot, slap-slap-slap, over the stream and into the wood where it's almost dark and frosty-dew twigs sting my legs. It don't mean a bloody thing to me, only to him, and it means as much to him as it would mean to me if I picked up the racing paper and put my bet on a hoss I didn't know, had never seen, and didn't care a sod if I ever did see. That's what it means to him. And I'll lose that race, because I'm not a race horse at all, and I'll let him know it when I'm about to get out~if I don't sling my hook even before the race. By Christ I will. I'm a human being and I've got thoughts and secrets and bloody life inside me that he doesn't know is there, and he'll never know what's there because he's stupid. I suppose you'll laugh at this, me saying the governor's a stupid bastard when I know hardly how to write and he can read and write and add-up like a professor. But what I say is true right enough. He's stupid, and I'm not, because I can see further into the likes of him than he can see into the likes of me. Admitted, we're both cunning, but I'm more cunning and I'll win in the end even if I die in gaol at eighty-two, because I'll have more fun and fire out of my life than he'll ever get out of his. He's read a thousand books I suppose, and for all I know he might even have written a few, but I know for a dead cert, as sure as I'm sitting here, that what I'm scribbling down is worth a million to what he could ever scribble down. I don't care what anybody says, but that's the truth and can't be denied. I know when he talks to me and I look into his army mug that I'm alive and he's dead.</p><h2>Underground Asia: Global Revolutionaries and the Overthrow of Europe&#39;s Empires in the East</h2><p>The end of Europe's empires has so often been seen as a story of high politics and warfare. In Tim Harper's remarkable new book the narrative is very different -it shows how empires were fundamentally undermined from underneath. Using the new technology of cheap printing presses, global travel and the widespread use of French and English, young radicals from across Asia were able to communicate in ways simply not available before. These clandestine networks stretched to the heart of the imperial metropolises: to London, to Paris, but also increasingly to Moscow.<br><br>They created a secret global network which was for decades engaged in bitterfighting with imperial police forces. They gathered in the great hubs of empire -Calcutta, Bombay, Singapore, Penang, Batavia, Hanoi, Shanghai and HongKong - and plotted with ceaseless ingenuity, both through persuasion and terrorism, the end of the colonial regimes. Many were caught and killed or imprisoned, but others would go on to rule their newly independent countries.<br><br>Drawing on an amazing array of exotic sources, Harper's book turns upsidedown our understanding of 20th-century empire. The reader enters an extraordinary world of stowaways, false identities, secret codes, cheap firearms, posters and conspiracies as young Asians made their own plans for their future.</p><p>Tim Harper is Professor of the History of Southeast Asia at the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of Magdalene College. He was the co-author with Christopher Bayly of two landmark Penguin books on the British Empire's experience of the Second World War in south and southeast Asia: <i>Forgotten Armies and Forgotten Wars</i>.</p><h2>The Monk of Mokha</h2><p><b><b>From the bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Circle </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>What Is the What</i></b><b>, the true story of a young Yemeni-American man, raised in San Francisco, who dreams of resurrecting the ancient art of Yemeni coffee but finds himself trapped in Sana'a by civil war.</b></b><br><br>Mokhtar Alkhanshali grew up in San Francisco, one of seven siblings brought up by Yemeni immigrants in a tiny apartment. At age twenty-four, unable to pay for college, he works as a doorman, until a statue of an Arab raising a cup of coffee awakens something in him. He sets out to learn the rich history of coffee in Yemen and the complex art of tasting and identifying varietals. He travels to Yemen and visits countless farms, collecting samples, eager to bring improved cultivation methods to the countryside. And he is on the verge of success when civil war engulfs Yemen in 2015. The US Embassy closes, Saudi bombs began to rain down on the country, and Mokhtar is trapped in Yemen. Desperate to escape, he embarks on a passage that has him negotiating with dueling political factions and twice kidnapped at gunpoint. With no other options, he hires a skiff to take him, and his coffee samples, across the Red Sea. A heart-pounding true story that weaves together the history of coffee, the ongoing Yemeni civil war, and the courageous journey of a young man--a Muslim and a US citizen--following the most American of dreams.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2018:</strong> <em>The Monk of Mokha</em> is an unblinking, open account of a San Francisco-based Yemeni American&#x2019;s success story. The sincerity and subject matter will make some cynics uneasy, and cynics would do well to avoid this book, or be less cynical. Following in the path of <em>What is the What</em> and <em>Zeitoun</em>, Eggers delivers us the real-life tale of Mokhtar Alkhanshali, a Muslim in his early twenties who appears to be on his way to a relatively undistinguished life. But when he discovers the historic Yemeni connection to coffee production, he embarks on a quest that will change his path and provide direction. The adventure itself is riveting, but when you add in the history of coffee, the story becomes even more elevated. Mokhtar is an inspirational character, and Dave Eggers has written an entertaining, inspirational, and informative book. -- <em>Chris Schluep for the Amazon Book Review</em><b>Dave Eggers</b> grew up near Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

They range from his memories of his schooldays, to his contributions to the debates on social policy and on war, his contributions in both world wars to the events and discourse, and his efforts after 1945 to see the world a better place. Martin Gilbert, Churchill's official biographer, has chosen passages that express to him the essence of Churchill's thoughts, and which describe in his own inimitable words the main adventures of his life, and the main crises of his career with Gilbert&#x2019;s own introduction and interlinking text.

But I urge you to try it; try it exactly according to the guidelines in this book. You may not understand then, either, but that&#39;s not essential. Try the equipment with a tape measure in hand and see what happens. If you work 40 hours a week and attend a university full time and have only worked out for two 20-minute sessions a week for three weeks, would you settle for a 12-pound body weight increase? This is what is happening to trainees I know who are using Nautilus equipment properly. As could be expected, the Nautilus machines are being misused by some people. They do too many sets and reps and work out too many days per week. They don&#39;t understand or can&#39;t accept what a productive took they have to work with. In essence, they&#39;re hitching a team of horses to an automobile and letting the animals pull the car. The object of Nautilus equipment is to enable to user to activate muscles completely, intensely, severely, thoroughly, and quickly. It isn&#39;t easier, it&#39;s just finished sooner. I know that it is difficult to accept ideas that are new, especially if they happen to challenge that which is near and dear to you. But remember-if you want to lead the orchestra, you have to turn your back on the crowd.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter</h2><p>CAUTION: You&#x2019;re about to enter the world of Ann Coulter<br><br><i>How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)</i>, the instant <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, shows why Ann Coulter has become the most recognized&#x2014;and controversial&#x2014;conservative intellectual in years.

There are always plenty of cigars and an inevitable cat. But his loyal fans lap up his books and will certainly welcome this newest addition. The Kinkster&#39;s boozy reporter (is there any another kind in mystery fiction?) friend McGovern is being plagued by FBI agents disguised as aliens, so Friedman sets off on a journey of discovery to Washington and Al Capone&#39;s old Chicago haunts.What do Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Jackie Collins, Joseph Heller, Bob Dylan, and Willie Nelson have in common? They're all Kinky Friedman fans, of course. These notables, along with a posse of critics, discovered the Kinkster some time ago, and immediately began heaping praise and other assorted objects on him: <blockquote> "The world's funniest, bawdiest, and most politically incorrect country music singer turned mystery writer . . . a classic. . . . The humor gleams as bright as Kinky's brontosaurusforeskin cowboy boots." -- The New York Times Book Review <p> "Kinky is the best whodunit writer to come along since Dashiell what's-his-name." -- Willie Nelson </p><p> "The Kinkster is a catcher, not in the rye, but in the sagebrush, and that's what is truly appealing about him and his work." -- Los Angeles Times </p><p> "Kinky, Mozart, Shakespeare -- with what could I equal them?" -- Joseph Heller </p></blockquote> Well, if you don't know what these folks are so excited about, then read <i>The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover</i> and you'll soon find out. <p> Filled with adventure, passion, excitement, and a fair amount of talk about cats and puppet heads, this latest installment in the on-going saga of man's inhumanity to the English language find New York's most cosmic private detective launched once again on an investigation that leads him far afield of both the law and the lower Manhattan loft he calls home. </p><p> In <i>The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover</i>, Kinky Friedman, the author, has Kinky Friedman, the detective (in real life, the two are not related), rush to the aid of a lovely young woman, only to find that he is up to his shin splints in trouble of a disconcerting kind. </p><p> Soon after Polly Price hires him to find her missing husband, Kinky smells a rat. But it's not until he's been shot by the D.C. police and locked in a burning limousine by a Chicago chauffeur that he realizes he may be the one with his tail in a trap. Then, when Michael McGovern, longtime friend and loyal member of the Village Irregulars, complains first of being watched by mysterious men, then of getting threatening phone calls from a dead gangster named Leaning Jesus, and finally disappears -- and along with him, the lovely Polly -- Kinky comes to the only conclusion the conceivably could link these disparate events: the FBI is after him! </p><p> As <i>The Washington Post Book World</i> said, "Nothing is sacred in a Kinky Friedman book. Friedman and his characters will take on any subject and have at it. Therein lies his charm." Well, in <i>The Love Song of J. Edger Hoover</i>, readers will find the ever-insouciant Kinky at his charming best.</p></p><h2>Chapman Boating Etiquette: Updated and Revised Edition (Chapman Nautical Guide)</h2><p><b>Chapman's indispensable "rule book" for boaters-now completely updated and thoroughly revamped, with all-new full color illustrations, a fresh contemporary design, and up-to-date information on boating etiquette.</b><br><br>Here is the volume for anyone who wants to know every aspect of boating custom, from displaying pennants to naming conventions to rules on the right of way.

Lochinvar sails the waters between eastern Long Island and the tip of Cape Cod, poking into deep harbors and shallow ponds, anchoring off fashionable resorts and in remote coves, encountering the rough and the smooth, and exploring, as is Bailey's way, the present life of the coast while keeping a perceptive eye on the past.<br>The Coast of Summer is an account of a season afloat into which is woven an autobiography of half a lifetime sailing New England waters. It portrays a number of unusual men and women - friends, acquaintances, and chance-met strangers - who live on these shores. Not least, it is an often amusing and sometimes touching record of how Bailey and his wife, Margot, struggle to coexist aboard Lochinvar, the nomadic home from which, by the end of summer, they are loath to come ashore.<br>For the armchair sailor, this book will be as gratifying as a full-sail breeze. To practical yachting people, it offers modestly but enticingly the fruits of much hard-won and not always heroic experience. And for readers curious about the bays and the sounds, the Cape and the islands (including Shelter, Gardiners, Fishers, Block, Prudence, the Elizabeths, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket), The Coast of Summer provides dramatic dips into history and personal incursions into contemporary high-season life. It amply demonstrates Bailey's ability to evoke wind and water, the way of a boat, and the lively interactions of individuals who depend upon the coast.</p><p>Armchair sailors and practical yachting people will treasure this account of half a lifetime spent on the waters of New England.Anthony Bailey was a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> for 35 years and is the author of eighteen books, both fiction and nonfiction, including <i>The Inside Passage</i>, <i>The Outer Banks</i> and <i>The Thousand Dollar Yacht</i>, also published by Sheridan House.

But Lieberman&#39;s good intentions pave the way for a brutal murder. A murder that will lead Lieberman into the darkest depths of Chicago crime and corruption, and into the kind of trouble that could get him killed . . .</p><p><p>Stuart M. Kaminsky (1934-2009) was one of the most prolific crime fiction authors of the last four decades. Born in Chicago, Kaminsky penned more than sixty novels over his lifetime. In 1981's Death of a Dissident, Kaminsky debuted Moscow police detective Porfiry Rostnikov, whose stories were praised for their accurate depiction of Soviet life. He died in St. Louis in 2009.</p>An overabundance of irrelevant character vignettes impedes Kaminsky's (Toby Peters and Inspector Rostnikov series) procedural, which features the partnership of Chicago cops Abe "Rabbi" Lieberman and Bill "Father Murphy" Hanrahan. When prostitute Estralda Valdez, a past informer, asks the pair for protection, tippler Hanrahan agrees to watch her apartment from a Chinese restaurant across the street. After Valdez is murdered during Hanrahan's watch, he and Lieberman investigate her death, despite the objections of their captain, who is unhappy about negative publicity; they were off duty while they were protecting Estralda and she was only a prostitute, after all. In pursuing the case, the cops encounter a variety of characters, each supplied with copious background. Yet because of the profuse but scattershot surface details, no one-- not even the major characters-- is believable. In fact, the wealth of unfocused information tends to irritate rather than illuminate. Inconsistencies also plague the story, especially when Valdez's mysterious sister, a key ingredient to the plot, is found among a group of characters with whom the detectives should have been familiar. Edgar Award-winner Kaminsky ( A Cold Red Sunrise ) is a facile writer working over a trite tale. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sourdough Breads and Coffee Cakes</h2><p>Expert baker provides complete breadmaking instructions, as well as 104 kitchen-tested recipes for starters and breads and cakes utilizing starters.

Born in Hibbing, Minnesota, and raised in Fargo, North Dakota, Maris was a small-town boy who unwillingly became a New York Yankee when he was traded by the Kansas City Athletics. Almost immediately, he was thrust into the glare of the big-city lights and found himself pursuing one of the most prestigious and most celebrated of all baseball records: Babe Ruth's single-season home run mark of 60, set in 1927. Thirty-four years later, Maris joylessly was drawn into the chase and found himself the eye in a storm of controversy. He became the center of attention he never sought and the recipient of a celebrity he didn't want. As a young sportswriter, Phil Pepe joined the fray on August 2, when he took over as the Yankees beat writer for the <i>New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun</i>, and he covered Maris' race for the record to the very end. Here is his firsthand account of that historic home run challenge and the man that conquered it.</p></p><p><p><b>Phil Pepe </b>was a New York Yankees beat writer for the <i>New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun</i> in 1961, where he covered Roger Maris' race for the single season home run record.

Yet the meaning of the text is often unclear. Part of the problem arises because, although 1 John is called an Epistle, it lacks the formal marks of an Epistle. In <i>1, 2, and 3 John</i>, John Painter illuminates the relationship 1, 2, and 3 John have to each other and to the Gospel.</p> <p>Painter explains the historical context of the Johannine Epistles using a socio-rhetorical approach. The writings are shown to reflect a situation of conflict and schism within the Johannine community; they seek to persuade the readers of the truth of the writer's message. In this truth, the readers are encouraged to abide if they would have the assurance of eternal life.</p> <p>Painter also examines the inseparable connection between belief and ethical life in active love for one another. Through the socio-rhetorical approach Painter brings to light the continuing relevance of these writings.</p> <p><i>1, 2, and 3 John</i> is divided into two parts.

Today, under the direction of Ian Hodder, excavations continues unabated. This multi-faceted biography tells the story of �atalh�yuek from a variety of angles. It tells the story of the discovery of the site, of those that directed excavations and the team of diggers and experts working there, as well as their relationships, rivalries and personal aims. However, the book also provides insights into the process of archaeology, discussing what the findings of the Neolithic `Dawn of Civilization&#39;. This behind-the-scenes look at the site and the people drawn to it each season is both engaging and informative, much like the site itself. `A revealing narrative of people and ideas at the working face of archaeology&#39; - Colin Renfrew.</p><p>"Michael Balter takes us on a fascinating journey through the excavations at one of the world's great archaeological sites. He provides an engrossing chronicle of one of the world's earliest farming villages and of the personalities and thoughts of the archaeologists engaged in the research -- the human side of archaeology." -- Brian Fagan, Emeritus Professor of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara <p>"A superb biography of a super archaeological site! Balter also demonstrates how this work is radically transforming what all archaeologists think and do. His carefully researched and compellingly written narrative, which makes readers feel as if they are there, will be read with pleasure and interest by professional archaeologists and all who are interested in archaeology. Balter's skillful weaving together of archaeological findings, the personalities and ambitions of a broad cast of archaeologists, and the evolution of archaeological thought makes this book a classic." -- Bruce Trigger, James McGill Professor, Department of Anthropology, McGill University, Montreal </p><p>"�atalh�y�k is not only an archaeological site of tremendous importance, it is one with a dramatic history -- both ancient and modern -- that Balter tells with verve and an abundance of personal detail. His book is foremost about a site that offers unique insights into the origins of our own civilization; but at the same time it is an evocative portrayal of the process of archaeology itself." -- Ian Tattersall, Curator, Division of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History </p><p>"An engagingly personal account of one of the most ambitious excavation projects currently in progress, undertaken at one of the world's great archaeological sites; a revealing narrative of people and ideas at the working face of archaeology." -- Colin Renfrew, Professor Emeritus, University of Cambridge </p><p>"Erudite and meticulously researched, The Goddess and the Bull takes us behind the scenes of archaeology on the world stage, revealing the pitched political battles, the sometimes battered egos, and the stubborn quest for knowledge at one of the world's most important archaeological sites, �atalh�y�k." -- Heather Pringle, author of The Mummy Congress</p>Thousands of years before the pyramids were built in Egypt, a great civilization arose on the Anatolian plains. <i>The Goddess and the Bull</i> details the dramatic quest by archaeologists to unearth the buried secrets of this huge, spectacularly well-preserved early farming settlement. <p>Here lie the origins of modern society&#x2014;the dawn of art, architecture, religion, the nuclear family&#x2014;even the first tangible evidence of human self-awareness, the world&#x2019;s oldest mirrors. Some archaeologists have claimed that a Mother Goddess was first worshipped at �atalh�y�k, which is now a site of pilgrimage for Goddess worshippers from all over the world. The excavations here have unearthed the seeds of the Neolithic Revolution, when prehistoric humans first abandoned the hunter-gatherer life they had known for millions of years, invented farming, and began living in houses and communities. </p><p>Michael Balter, the excavation&#x2019;s official "biographer," brings readers behind the scenes, providing the first inside look at the remarkable site and its history of scandal and thrilling scientific discovery. He tells the human story of two colorful men: British archaeologist James Mellaart, who discovered �atalh�y�k in 1958 only to be banned from working at the site forever after a fabulous Bronze Age treasure he had found earlier disappeared without a trace; and Ian Hodder, a path-breaking archaeological rebel, who reinvented the way archaeology is practiced and reopened the excavation after it lay dormant for three decades. Today Hodder leads an international team of more than one hundred archeologists who continue to probe the site&#x2019;s ancient secrets. </p><p>Balter pulls the curtain on romantic notions about archaeology to reveal the true story behind modern excavations&#x2014;the thrill of history-making scientific discovery as well as the crushing disappointments, the community and friendship, the love affairs, and the often bitter rivalries between warring camps of archaeologists. Along the way, Balter describes the cutting-edge advances in archaeological science that have allowed the team at �atalh�y�k to illuminate the central questions of human existence.</p></p><h2>The Penguin Dictionary of Surnames (Penguin Reference Books)</h2><p>Explains the meaning and etymology of hundreds of English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish first names, localities, and nicknames</p><p></p><h2>The Genius of China: 3000 Years of Science, Discovery and Invention</h2><p>The Chinese invented the suspension bridge, the fishing reel, the stirrup, the parachute, paper money, playing cards, the decimal system, the seismograph, the blast furnace and mustard gas.

Reprint.</p><p>A few years ago, Ireland was forced to confront its conscience when a 14-year-old girl, the purported victim of rape, sought an abortion in England. The ensuing legal and moral battles exposed the Emerald Isle's centuries-long struggles over religion, sexuality, and the position of women. Irish writer Edna O'Brien revisits this embattled territory in her novel <i>Down by the River</i>, a bleak, uncompromising chronicle of poverty, unwanted pregnancy, and despair. O'Brien's protagonist is Mary, almost 14 years old and pregnant by her widowed father. In a repressed, judgmental rural world, Mary can tell no one of her plight. Eventually she tries to drown herself, only to be rescued by a neighbor, Betty. When Betty learns the reason for Mary's suicide attempt, she arranges to take her to England for an abortion. Before the operation can occur, Mary is coerced into returning to Ireland and there she becomes the focal point in a ferocious nationwide debate about abortion. <p> O'Brien is unsparing in her depictions of the economic and emotional poverty in which her characters live, yet she can be surprisingly empathetic toward even the least likeable among them, showing, for example, the tender side of Mary's father even as she exposes his brutality. The book's language is rich and laden with imagery, at times in shocking contrast to the parched lives she describes. <i>Down by the River</i> is just the latest in a long line of fiercely honest books by a fearlessly honest author.</p>Edna O'Brien is the author of 19 books. She was the winner of the 1993 Writers Guild Prize for Fiction. Her biography of James Joyce was published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in June 1999. Her recent fiction has been about Irish topics - religion, politics, property. In 2001 her documentary novel, In the Forest - about a brutal murder on the west coast - caused a furore in her native Ireland.

His energetic and upbeat manner belies this grisly documentary, which exposes an industry that preys on people&#39;s hope that they can return from the dead. Author Larry Johnson, a paramedic with 25 years of experience, joined a cryonics firm, only to discover that the staff performed unrequested euthanasia, dumped their leftovers into storm drains, and warehoused Ted Williams&#39;s frozen remains against his prior wishes. What started as a new career became this audiobook, a whistle-blower&#39;s expos� of alleged malicious deception. Making light of dying can prove tricky, but Dufris strikes just the right tone to have it all work.

It is evolvingswiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour.</p><p>Every attempt to destroy it has failed.</p><p>And we are the prey.</p></p><p>In <i>Prey</i>, bestselling author Michael Crichton introduces bad guys that are too small to be seen with the naked eye but no less deadly or intriguing than the runaway dinosaurs that made 1990's <i>Jurassic Park</i> such a blockbuster success.<p> High-tech whistle-blower Jack Forman used to specialize in programming computers to solve problems by mimicking the behavior of efficient wild animals--swarming bees or hunting hyena packs, for example. Now he's unemployed and is finally starting to enjoy his new role as stay-at-home dad. All would be domestic bliss if it were not for Jack's suspicions that his wife, who's been behaving strangely and working long hours at the top-secret research labs of Xymos Technology, is having an affair. When he's called in to help with her hush-hush project, it seems like the perfect opportunity to see what his wife's been doing, but Jack quickly finds there's a lot more going on in the lab than an illicit affair. Within hours of his arrival at the remote testing center, Jack discovers his wife's firm has created self-replicating nanotechnology--a literal swarm of microscopic machines. Originally meant to serve as a military eye in the sky, the swarm has now escaped into the environment and is seemingly intent on killing the scientists trapped in the facility. The reader realizes early, however, that Jack, his wife, and fellow scientists have more to fear from the hidden dangers within the lab than from the predators without.</p><p> The monsters may be smaller in this book, but Crichton's skill for suspense has grown, making <i>Prey</i> a scary read that's hard to set aside, though not without its minor flaws. The science in this novel requires more explanation than did the cloning of dinosaurs, leading to lengthy and sometimes dry academic lessons. And while the coincidence of Xymos's new technology running on the same program Jack created at his previous job keeps the plot moving, it may be more than some readers can swallow. But, thanks in part to a sobering foreword in which Crichton warns of the real dangers of technology that continues to evolve more quickly than common sense, <i>Prey</i> succeeds in gripping readers with a tense and frightening tale of scientific suspense. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p><p><strong>Michael Crichton</strong>&nbsp;(1942-2008) was the author of the bestselling novels<em>&nbsp;The Terminal Man,&nbsp;The Great Train Robbery,&nbsp;Jurassic Park, Sphere,&nbsp;Disclosure, Prey, State of Fear,</em>&nbsp;<em>Next </em>and<em>&nbsp;Dragon Teeth</em>,&nbsp;among many others.

Wood--winner of the Pulitzer Prize and professor of American history at Brown University--had no idea what he was getting into when he began this 653-page book. Innocently, he wanted to write a &#34;monographic analysis of constitution-making in the Revolutionary era.&#34; Little did he know he would discover an intellectual world where a complete transformation of political thought was occurring, one that would create &#34;a distinctly American system of politics.&#34; As Wood explains, &#34;Beneath the variety and idiosyncrasies of American opinion there emerged a general pattern of beliefs about the social process--a set of common assumptions about history, society, and politics that connected and made significant seemingly discrete and unrelated ideas. Really for the first time I began to glimpse what late eighteenth-century Americans meant when they talked about living in an enlightened age.&#34; This original study of the American political system is a strong contribution to the scholarly studies of the events surrounding the nation&#39;s independence."One of the half dozen most important books ever written about the American Revolution."-- <i>New York Times Book Review</i> <br></p><h2>Paul, Missionary Theologian: A Survey of his Missionary Labours and Theology</h2><p><p>A compelling presentation of Paul's theology enriched by insights from the field of Systematic theology. <br></p><p>It is BIOGRAPHICAL, THEOLOGICAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, MISSIOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL, HERMENEUTICAL, INSPIRATIONAL! </p></p><p>Robert L. Reymond (1932-2013) taught for more than 25 years on the faculties of Covenant Theological Seminary (St. Louis, Missouri) and Knox Theological Seminary (Ft. Lauderdale, Florida). He held degrees from Bob Jones University and did post-doctoral studies at Fuller Seminary, New York University, Union Seminary (New York), Tyndale House, Cambridge, and Rutherford House, Edinburgh.... an excellent an inspiring book, and will probably become a standard work. It should be on the shelves of every minister, theological student, and missionary. (Churchman Journal)<br><br>... every element of Paul's theology is shown to have missionary significance. Reymond interacts with the most up to date scholarly views and provides a reliable conservative study of the great missionary theologian from which every serious Christian reader will profit. (David McKay ~ Professor of Systematic Theology, Ethics and Apologetics, Reformed Theological College, Belfast, Northern Ireland)<br><br>This book is like a breath of fresh air to those who want to seriously study Paul as a person, a man with a mission and as a theologian. It covers all three areas of his life in harmony, leaving the reader with an all round picture of Paul. We often think of Paul as the great Apostle, giant among the early writers of Scripture and yes he was. This approach does much to dehumanize the man. Within the pages of this book I found that the human element had been restored, I found myself identifying with the man, and not just the Apostle. It is thoroughly academic, it sometimes becomes a little bogged down with footnotes, but the structure, layout, are fairly easy to follow and after a few pages begin too become more accessible. The book follows a biographical note, starting with Paul's early history and working through to his final days of ministry. It is split into two sections - part 1 Paul's missionary labours which is biographical and part 2 Paul's missionary theology, which examines his theology. I can safely put it on my shelf next to FW Farrer and D Smith, such is its quality and depth. (CLC Reviews)<br><br>Those who have read and appreciated Robert Reymond's A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith, will be delighted with this new volume on the apostle Paul... Reymond's biblical and theological exposition of particular themes, for example, on canonicity, imputation, justification and the Holy Spirit, is superb and stimulating. (ATB McGowan ~ Minister, East Church of Scotland, Inverness)<br><br>'This is quite a book! It tackles a big subject and grapples with it in a big way... Professor Reymond is both a New Testament scholar and a theologian, roles not always combined. He writes with admirable clarity and never evades issues, either exegetical or theological.' (Geoffrey Grogan ~ (1925-2011), Principal of Glasgow Bible College and well-respected author)<br><br>'This excellent volume examines Paul's theology and practice of mission.

This diary, which he kept in four notebooks over six weeks, is the only sustained, on-the-spot written account we have by a major artist of the experience of entering psychosis.<br><br>Nijinsky's diary was first published in 1936, in a heavily bowdlerized version that omitted almost half of his text. The present edition, translated by Kyril FitzLyon, is the first complete version in English and the first version in any language to include the fourth notebook, which was written at the very edge of madness. It contains Nijinsky's last lucid thoughts--on God, sex, war, and the nature of the universe, as well as on his own broken life. In her Introduction, the noted dance writer Joan Acocella explains the context of the diary and its place in the history of modernism.<br></p><p>Vaslav Nijinsky spent the final six weeks before his permanent consignment to an insane asylum as something a madman in the attic. With his family--wife, young daughters and occasionally, mother-in-law--and household staff downstairs, the legendary dancer retreated to his room in a remote Swiss villa to tangle with his burgeoning psychosis. Fearful that his wife would (as she ultimately did) commit him, and highly suspicious of the physician-cum-amateur psychiatrist who daily came by to examine him, Nijinsky perceived the diary as the only safe haven for the rambling thoughts that were overtaking him. Throughout, the anxiety and anguish are palpable, as Nijinsky writes about his disillusionment with his mentor and lover, Ballets Russes director Serge Diaghilev; his alienation from and distrust of his closest family members; and his fear of insanity and its consequential confinement. His writing becomes more obscure as the weeks progress and he examines his relationship to God, writing "I am God" at one point, and later: "God said to me, 'Go home and tell your wife that you are mad.'" As his schizophrenia evolves, the pace and style of Nijinsky's prose changes radically--toward the end he writes in abstract verse--but he remains, with a dancer's sensibility, attuned to the cadences of his environment. The noises of the household, the ringing of the phone, footsteps down the hall, smatterings of conversations overheard are all registered as a sort of accompaniment to his dance with madness and function perhaps as a final tether to reality.<p> Nijinsky's wife stumbled upon the diary in a locked trunk some years after her husband disappeared into the abyss of madness and soon released it for publication to feed public interest in her famous mate--but not before she sanitized the manuscript to such a degree (removing references to his homosexuality, overblown ego, bizarre paranoia, and various obsessions with bodily functions and sex acts) that its essence was obscured. Now 80 years after it was written, 20 years after its renegade editor died, and six years after the copyright that Nijinsky's daughters held expired, the unexpurgated version of the diaries faithfully restores the fascinating record of a great artist's struggle for his life.</p><p>A uniquely personal record of a great artist&#x2019;s descent into madness</p><p>In his prime, Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950) was the most celebrated man in Western ballet--a virtuoso and a dramatic dancer such as European and American audiences had never seen before. After his triumphs in such works as The Specter of the Rose and Petrouchka, he set out to make ballets of his own, and with his Afternoon of a Faun and The Rite of Spring, created within a year of each other, he became ballet&#x2019;s first modernist choreographer. Then, still in his twenties, he began to go mad.</p><p>For six weeks in early 1919, as his tie to reality was giving way, Nijinsky kept a diary--the only sustained daily record we have, by a major artist, of the experience of entering psychosis. In some entries he is filled with hope. He is God; he will save the world. In other entries, he falls into a black despair. He is dogged by sexual obsessions, and by grief over World War I. Furthermore, he is afraid that he is going insane.</p><p>The diary was first published in 1936, in a version heavily bowdlerized by Nijinsky&#x2019;s wife. The new edition, translated by Kyril FitzLyon, is the first complete and accurate English rendering of this searing document. In her introduction, the noted dance critic Joan Acocella tells Nijinsky&#x2019;s story and places it in the context of early European modernism.</p></p><h2>Burying the Sun</h2><p><p>In the glorious springtime of 1941 Leningrad seems as though it will always be bright.

She lives in northern Michigan. </p>Grade 5-8&#x2013;Haunting images and elegant prose make this companion to <i>The Impossible Journey</i> (2003) and <i>Angel on the Square</i> (2001, both HarperCollins) memorable. Fourteen-year-old Georgi; his sister, Marya; and their mother live in a tiny apartment in Leningrad in 1941. As news of the advancing German army reaches the city, the residents prepare for war. Georgi, too young to join the Russian army, volunteers wherever he can. Marya works at the Hermitage museum, where she helps pack up the magnificent artwork to be shipped away for safe storage. As the German army moves closer and begins bombing, the city is cut off from outside help. Starvation sets in, and the citizens struggle to survive. Georgi, his family, and their neighbors keep hope alive by focusing on the beauty in the world, from a chocolate bar to a Shostakovich symphony. The lilting writing style and simple dignity of the characters help construct an honest portrait of everyday life in extraordinary circumstances. From the renowned poet Anna Akhmatova reading her work on the radio to the first bloom of spring flowers, the people cling to visions of light. The plot moves quickly, but the bleak details of war are not spared. The staunch determination of the human spirit will linger with readers long after the last page is turned.<i>&#x2013;Kristen Oravec, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Strongsville, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through interviews, participant-observation, and analysis of movement literature, Cynthia Eller explores what women who worship the goddess believe; how they express those beliefs in private, in public, and in the political realm; and the place of feminist spirituality in the history of American religion.</p><p>Insightful and well-researched, <i>Living in the Lap of the Goddess</i> does justice to the vast array of theories and styles that make up spiritual feminism -- <i>Women's Review of Books</i>One of the most rapidly growing religious movements in the United States, feminist spirituality first came of age during the religious ferment of the 1960s. It has since emerged as one of the sturdiest survivors of that era of religious experimentation. The goddess, her worshipers, and the myth of her reign over humankind&#39;s prehistory are becoming familiar features in the American religious landscape, and are gradually spreading beyond there, out into the cultural mainstream. In spite of its increasing cultural presence, feminist spirituality is poorly understood by those not participating in its development or privy to its secrets. Why do these women worship a goddess, and who is she? What do they do when they meet together? What do they do alone? What attracts them to feminist spirituality? Are they part of a passing cult or are they creating a new religion that will one day take its place alongside Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in the West? What are their hopes for the world, and what are they doing to see their dreams actualized? Living in the Lap of the Goddess answers these questions and more. Drawing on scores of interviews with spiritual feminists, participant-observation in feminist spirituality&#39;s rituals and retreats, and a close reading of the movement&#39;s many texts, sociologist of religion Cynthia Eller describes this innovative spiritual movement in detail. Among the topics covered are the origins of feminist spirituality; its use of ritual, myth and magic; and the politics with which spiritual feminists determinedly intertwine their religion. The feminist spirituality movement represents an important option for feminists, the critical third choice available in the falsedilemma between reforming patriarchal religions and giving up on religion altogether. Living in the Lap of the Goddess introduces the reader to this important option, and the infinite variety that is the feminist spirituality movement. Memorable characters are met in the pages of this book, and novel theories on gender, deity, human civilization, and the universe are encountered. Throughout, the key question guiding this venture into the alternative religious world is this: Who are these women, and why are they doing what they do, saying what they say, thinking what they think? The answers, like the participants themselves, are manifold and intriguing.</p><h2>Horse Fantastic</h2><p>A collection of equine fantasy stories includes original works by Anne McCaffrey, Jennifer Roberson, Mercedes Lackey, Mickey Zucker Riechert, Mike Resnick, Nancy Springer, and others</p><p><strong>Martin H.

The text sets out to accomplish this goal in two fundamental ways. First, the pedagogy &#34;recalls&#34; previous topics and skills by way of Just in Time exercises and references. Through these devices, students receive consistent prompts that enable them to better remember and apply what they have learned. Second, exercise sets integrate skills, applications, and concepts so that students can view mathematics from multiple perspectives. Ultimately, the hope is that through College Algebra: Building Concepts and Connections, students will develop a better conceptual understanding of the subject and achieve greater preparedness for future math courses.</p><p></p><h2>The Classic Philip Jose Farmer, 1952-1964 (Classics of Modern Science Fiction Volume 4)</h2><p>Contains a collection of early science-fiction short stories by popular author Philip Jose Farmer</p><p></p><h2>Northanger Abbey, Lady Susan, The Watsons, Sanditon (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>Northanger Abbey</em> depicts the misadventures of Catherine Morland, young, ingenuous, and mettlesome, and an indefatigable reader of gothic novels.

What could be more remote from the uneventful securities of life in the midland counties of England? Yet as Austen brilliantly contrasts fiction with reality, ordinary life takes a more sinister turn, and edginess and circumspection are reaffirmed alongside comedy and literary burlesque.<br> Also including Austen's other short fictions, <em>Lady Susan</em>, <em>The Watsons</em>, and <em>Sanditon</em>, this valuable new edition shows her to be as innovative at the start of her career as at its close.</p><p>Claudia L.

She is captivated, but her parents insist that ...we are not a Christmas family. We are a Korean family. However, after Yoon points out that they are both American and Korean, her parents figure out a way to meld a Christmas tradition with their own New Year's celebration. Yoon's round and expressive face is depicted as captivated, joyous, and implacable by turns, and her holiday imaginings are rendered as sprightly, juggling Korean-looking elves and a surreal but childlike North Pole. Her parents are rather suddenly and easily convinced to let the tradition of Santa into their home, but children and parents alike will be charmed by Yoon's yearning and determination to experience a bit of Christmas magic.<i>&#x2013;Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ghandl was born in 1851 in a small Haida island community off the coast of British Columbia. His world was devastated by waves of European diseases, which wiped out over ninety percent of the Haidas and robbed him of his sight. He became a skilled listener, taking in the myths, legends, and everyday stories of his people. Creatively adapting them, the blind storyteller became a master of his craft. In 1900 John Swanton, with the help of a translator, transcribed a number of Ghandl's narrative poems.<p>Nearly all of the poems in this volume are <i>qqaygaang</i>, narrative poems set in the Haida mythtime of long ago. One story, &#x201c;The Names of Their Gambling Sticks,&#x201d; is a <i>qqayaagaang</i>, a story that juxtaposes mythtime and historical time and is the property of a Haida family. Each poem creatively enacts a myth in a way that illuminates and celebrates the traditional world of the Haidas and reveals Ghandl's own acute sense of the foibles and great potential of all human beings. Meticulously and sensitively translated and annotated by Robert Bringhurst, these stories have finally been given the attention they deserve.</p></p><p>The author of <i>A Story as Sharp as a Knife: The Classical Haida Mythtellers and Their World</i> (Nebraska 2000) and <i>The Black Canoe: Bill Reid and the Spirit of Haida Gwaii</i>, Robert Bringhurst is one of Canada's most respected poets and cultural historians.Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Live Like a Missionary: Giving Your Life for What Matters Most</h2><p>Are you frustrated by your ineffectiveness in sharing the gospel and winning people to Jesus Christ?

He is a Fellow at the London Business School where he was a professor for many years. His books have sold over one million copies around the world. He has been, in his time, an oil executive, a business economist, a professor, and Chairman of the Royal Society of Arts.<br>As a graceful and challenging follow-up to The Age of Unreason (1990), Handy makes a pitch for more humanely adaptive responses to the convulsive transformations he says are in store for the industrial West. The author, a consultant, concedes that socioeconomic change has proceeded at an appreciably faster and more deranging pace than he had anticipated, creating a fresh new series of puzzlements. One paradox is that organizations and institutions are becoming simultaneously larger and smaller (e.g., the reorganization of IBM into component companies). Many companies have obliged workers to become more flexible and to act with a previously discouraged level of independence. Among the consequences that Handy admits he failed to foresee are that opportunities for personal fulfillment would be complicated by demands for ever greater efficiency, that the price of success would rise to intolerable levels, and that welcome new freedoms would be achieved at the cost of old equalities. This time around, the author examines a wealth of possibilities for reconciling the apparent contradictions of a brave new world in which megacorporations have been cut down to size and have pared their payrolls to subsistence levels, imposing onerous burdens on layoff survivors. Among other proposals for achieving a kinder, gentler workplace, he commends the existential enterprise (a philosophic extension of the stakeholder concept, which holds that companies should serve a host of constituencies as well as their investors) and subsidiarity (Handy's alternative to the still trendy notion of empowerment). He also addresses such knotty issues as the difficulties involved in establishing ownership of intellectual property, putting a price on knowledge, and the implications of what he terms ``portfolio careers''--the increasing number of freelance contractors in a service economy. While he urges individuals toward self-reliance, Handy also calls for innovative means to chase the ends of a more just polity and more inclusive sense of community. Anecdotal antidotes to the discontents and discontinuities of the present fin de si&#x160;cle from a lively and open mind. (First printing of 30,000) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Jones lives in Nelson, British Columbia.</p>Grade 2-4&#x2013;Written to honor the 60th anniversary of the film by the actor who played Tommy Bailey, this original story places his character in the limelight while merely rehashing the plot of the movie. As a young boy, he, like his father George, intervenes in a few situations to improve the course of people's lives. Then, at 11, Tommy misplaces the money that his sixth-grade class collected for the library fund and, feeling desperate, runs to the town bridge, wishing he'd never been born. Magically, a novice angel appears to show him how many lives he has touched, and the rest is predictable. The film's charitable themes are adequately transposed to the book, and the illustrations nicely convey the tale's old-fashioned wholesomeness. However, with a film as beloved and widely available as this one, it is hard to imagine why anyone would need this rather superfluous book.

Against this primitive backdrop, they encounter ominous and mysterious modern infrastructure and are warned against angering a demi-god race known as Torkral. Being savvy space-farers, our heroes recognize the Torkral as an old race of marooned fellow space travelers who have harnessed the energy of the plant (and its indigenous people) to preserve their own dwindling race.

Warm, witty, loving, often hilarious, and poignant in its affection for a glorious era in the American theater, it is the story of what Mr. Lerner calls "the sundown of wit, eccentricity, and glamour." The author himself, try as he will to keep himself out of his pages, emerges not merely as a great talent, but as a man of laughter and love. His principals, however, are Moss Hart and Fritz Loewe, with a stupendous supporting cast: Julia Andrews, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Cecil Beaton, Louis Jourdan, Maurice Chevalier, Leslie Caron, Vincente Minnelli, Arthur Freed . . . and on an on. They are seen intimately in moments of triumph, disaster, doubt and panic, pettishness and hilarity. Sometimes they were amateurs at private living, but they were always professionals at the creation of theater. And the creation of theater is the matrix of this wonderful book. Here is how a show is conceived, financed, written (and rewritten and rewritten), produced, staged, saved, and finally given to the public.</p><p>Alan Jay Lerner (1918&#x2013;1986) was an American lyricist who created some of the most popular and enduring works of musical theater in the world.A pure delight. Lerner, a librettist, and his partner, composer Fritz Loewe, were giants of the American musical theater. Together they were responsible for such Broadway hits as BRIGADOON, PAINT YOUR WAGON, MY FAIR LADY, GIGI and CAMELOT. David Case&#39;s reading captures Lerner&#39;s understated brilliance, wit and sophistication, and provides insight into how much hard work it took to make it all look easy. The listener is transported into a sadly bygone era of magic and grace when giants like Moss Hart, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison ruled the stage. These are cruder times, full of coarser fare, but this audio will leave you humming. &#34;Oh, wouldn&#39;t it be lover-ly.&#34; M.D.B.

Rosenthal, M.D., a twenty-year researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health and the celebrated psychiatrist who pioneered the study and treatment of Season Affective Disorder (SAD), brings us the most important work on Transcendental Meditation since the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's <em>Science of Being and Art of Living</em>-- and one of our generation's most significant books on achieving greater physical and mental health and wellness. <br><br> <em>Transcendence</em> demystifies the practice and benefits of Transcendental Meditation for a general audience who may have heard about the method but do not necessarily know what it is, how it is learned, or what they stand to gain, physically and emotionally, from achieving transcendence. Dr. Rosenthal clearly and practically explains the basic ideas behind Transcendental Meditation: It is a nonreligious practice that involves sitting comfortably for twenty minutes twice a day while using a silent mantra, or nonverbal sound, to attain a profound state of aware relaxation. <br><br> Alongside exclusive celebrity interviews-where figures like Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Martin Scorsese, Russell Brand, Laura Dern, Moby, and David Lynch openly discuss their meditation-Dr. Rosenthal draws upon experience from the lives of his patients and a wealth of clinical research amassed on TM over the past generation (340 peer-reviewed published articles). He provides the fullest and most accessible book ever on the broad range of benefits of this remarkably simple practice, from relief of anxiety, stress and depression to new hope for those experiencing addiction, attention-deficit disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder.<br><br>"Dr. Norman Rosenthal's <em>Transcendence</em> is the best-ever book on Transcendental Meditation: accessible and substantive, engaging and scientific, practical and profound. A very enjoyable read that can change your life, for good."--David Lynch <br><br> "I have been meditating for over 10 years, and I found <em>Transcendence</em> to be a uniquely compelling introduction to the art and science of Transcendental Meditation.

That&#x2019;s just how she said it. "Elvira&#x2019;s not quite..." <p></p>When she let her voice trail off like that I knew precisely what she meant. I knew it in the pit of my stomach. I had been coming down the stairs to join them in the drawing room when I heard her speaking, and stopped dead, clutching the handrail in my left hand and the bunched seersucker of my skirt in the other. It was 1960 and skirts in the spring collections were long enough that they had to be lifted a little to avoid stepping on them on the stairs. <p></p>Mrs. Maynard&#x2019;s friend, Lady Bellingham, made a little sound of inarticulate sympathy. There could be no question what Mrs. Maynard meant, no way that I could think&#x2014;or that anyone could think&#x2014;she meant not quite ready, or not quite well, though I knew if I challenged her that&#x2019;s what she would say. "Not quite out of the top drawer" is what she really meant; "not quite a lady." I was still "not quite up to snuff," despite eight years in the best and most expensive girls&#x2019; schools in England and a year in Switzerland being "finished." At eighteen I still had two distinct voices: the voice that went with my clothes and my hair, the voice that was indistinguishable in its essentials from Betsy Maynard&#x2019;s, and then the much less acceptable voice of my childhood, the London Cockney voice. My past was never to be forgotten, not quite, however hard I tried. <p></p>"Then why ever are you bringing her out with Betsy?" Lady Bellingham asked, her voice positively oozing sympathy the way an �clair oozes cream. <p></p>"Well her uncle, you know," Mrs. Maynard said. "He&#x2019;s the head of the Watch. One doesn&#x2019;t like..." <p></p>Spending time with Mrs. Maynard, you get used to trailing sentences with everything explicit but nothing spelled out. I could have run down the stairs and pushed into the drawing room and shouted that it wasn&#x2019;t anything like so simple. Mrs. Maynard was bringing me out because her daughter Betsy had begged me to go through with it. "I can&#x2019;t face being a deb without you!" she had said. Betsy and I were friends because, in the alphabetically arranged classroom at Arlinghurst, "Elizabeth" and "Elvira" happened to fall next to each other, and Betsy and I had both felt like misfits and clung to each other ever since. I didn&#x2019;t give more than half a damn about coming out and being presented to the Queen. What I wanted was to go to Oxford. You may think it was an odd ambition. Half the people I met did. Going by my born social status rather than my acquired one I couldn&#x2019;t even hope to be admitted. Still, I had been interviewed and accepted at St. Hilda&#x2019;s and had only the summer to wait before I went up. It was April already. Most girls I knew would have hated the idea of grinding away at their books, but I&#x2019;d always found that side of things easy; it was parties that bored me. But Betsy and Uncle Carmichael had set their hearts on my coming out, so I had agreed I would do that first. <p></p>Besides all that, Mrs. Maynard was bringing me out because my uncle, who wasn&#x2019;t really my uncle at all, was paying for me and subsidizing Betsy. However County the Maynards might be, they never had much money to spare, at least by their own standards. By the standards I&#x2019;d grown up with they were impossibly rich, but by those of the people they moved among, they were struggling to keep up appearances. Anyway, people with money are often horribly mean; that was the first thing I&#x2019;d learned when I&#x2019;d started to move among them. But, sickeningly, none of that got a mention. Mrs. Maynard&#x2019;s trailing off made it sound as if she was bringing me out despite my deficiencies because she was afraid of my uncle. <p></p>"Might I trouble you for a little more tea, dear?" Lady Bellingham asked. <p></p>The banisters were Victorian and rounded, like chair legs, with big round knobs on the newel posts. Between them I could see down into the hall, the faded cream wallpaper, the top of the mahogany side table, and a crystal vase of pinky-white carnations. The house was narrow, like all Victorian London houses. I could see the drawing room door, which was open, but I couldn&#x2019;t see in through it, so I didn&#x2019;t know if Betsy was sitting there too. It seemed terribly important to find out if she was listening to all this without protest. I let go of my handful of skirt and slipped off my shoes, feeling absurd, knowing that while I was fairly safe from Mrs. Maynard, the servants could come out of the back part of the house at any time and catch me. They probably wouldn&#x2019;t give me away, but it would still be frightfully embarrassing. I ran one hand lightly down the banister rail and tiptoed gingerly down the strip of carpet in the center of the stairs to the half-landing, where I could see through the drawing room door if I stretched a bit. <p></p>I took a good grip, leaned out, and craned my neck. Mrs. Maynard was eating a cream cake with a fork. She was not seen to advantage from above, as she had a squashed-up face like a pug and wore her graying brown hair in a permanent wave so rigid it looked like a helmet. Her afternoon dress was a muslin patterned with roses, that made her stocky figure look as upholstered as the chair she sat in. Lady Bellingham, on the sofa and reaching towards the tea trolley for a sandwich, looked softer, thinner, and altogether more fashionable. I had just determined to my satisfaction that they were alone, when with no warning at all the front door opened. <p></p>Of course they saw me at once. They couldn&#x2019;t help it. Mr. Maynard, Betsy&#x2019;s father, took me in with one rapid glance, raised his eyebrows, and looked away. The other man with him was a complete stranger with a dark piratical beard and a perfectly normal bowler hat. I felt myself turn crimson as I pulled myself back onto the half-landing and slipped my shoes back on. <p></p>"Ah, Elvira," Mr. Maynard said, with no inflection whatever. I didn&#x2019;t know him well. He did something boring and diplomatic to which I&#x2019;d never paid much attention and which seemed to take up a great deal of his time. On holidays I&#x2019;d spent with Betsy he&#x2019;d never paid much attention to me. "Sir Alan, this is my daughter&#x2019;s friend Elvira Royston, whom my wife is bringing out with Betsy this summer. Elvira, this is Sir Alan Bellingham." <p></p>"Delighted to meet you," I said, coming down the stairs and extending my hand as I had been so painstakingly taught. <p></p>Sir Alan ignored my fading blushes and shook hands firmly. He was almost exactly my height, and looked me in the eye. "Charmed," he murmured. "I don&#x2019;t suppose you know if my mother is here?" <p></p>"She&#x2019;s taking tea with Mrs. Maynard in the drawing room," I said, blushing again. <p></p>"And Betsy?" Mr. Maynard asked. <p></p>"I don&#x2019;t know where she is," I said, honestly. "I haven&#x2019;t seen her since lunchtime." <p></p>"See if you can rustle her up, there&#x2019;s a good girl. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;d be glad to see Sir Alan. You&#x2019;ll take a cup of tea, Sir Alan, while you wait for your mother to be ready?" <p></p>Sir Alan smiled at me. Because of the beard, I couldn&#x2019;t tell how old he was. At first I had thought he was Mr. Maynard&#x2019;s age, but when he smiled I thought he was much younger, maybe no more than thirty. <p></p>"I&#x2019;ll find her if she&#x2019;s at home," I said, and turned and went back upstairs to look for Betsy. <p></p>I tapped on her door. <p></p>"Who is it?" she called. <p></p>"Me," I said, opening the door. Betsy was lying on the bed in a green check dress that looked distinctly rumpled. "Your father wants you to come down and drink tea, but you&#x2019;d better tidy yourself up first." <p></p>She sighed and sat up. "Who&#x2019;s here?" <p></p>"That bitch Lady Bellingham, and a mysterious stranger called Sir Alan who seems to be her son." <p></p>Betsy lay down again and put her pillow on her head. "He&#x2019;s not a mysterious stranger, he&#x2019;s my father&#x2019;s idea of a suitable son-in-law," she said, her voice rather muffled. "Do go down and tell them I&#x2019;m mortally wounded and not likely to make it." <p></p>"Don&#x2019;t be a ninny," I said, pulling off the pillow. "They can&#x2019;t make you marry a man with a beard." <p></p>"Ghastly Lady B. is Mummy&#x2019;s best friend, and her son&#x2019;s frightfully rich and doing things with the government that seem likely to make him even more frightfully rich, and powerful as well. And he&#x2019;s very polite, which makes him perfect in Mummy&#x2019;s eyes. You don&#x2019;t know how lucky you are being an orphan, Elvira." <p></p>In fact, my mother was alive and well and running a pub in Leytonstone, but I thought it better never to mention her in my daily life. She certainly wasn&#x2019;t going to interfere. She hadn&#x2019;t wanted me when she ran off with her fancy man when I was six, and she hadn&#x2019;t wanted me when my father died when I was eight, so she wasn&#x2019;t likely to want me now. I hardly remembered her, but my aunt Ciss, my real aunt, my father&#x2019;s sister, kept me up to date with gossip about her. Aunt Ciss would have taken me in, even though she had five children of her own, but she thought having Uncle Carmichael take an interest in me and offering to send me to Arlinghurst was a great opportunity for me to make something of myself. I&#x2019;d thought it a funny phrase then, like making stew of a neck of lamb, or a fruit cobbler of two bruised apples and a squashy pear. What they had hoped to make of me was a lady, and I&#x2019;d been too young to question why anyone thought this would be better than what I would have grown into if let alone. It was only in the last year or so I had wondered about this at all, as I&#x2019;d grown old enough to consider what they had made of me so far and what I might want to make of myself, given the opportunity. <p></p>"Put on a clean dress and come down, do," I said. "I&#x2019;ll do my best to draw the cross fire." <p></p>That made her smile. It was, of course, Bogart&#x2019;s famous line from the end of The Battle of Kursk. She stood up and pulled her dress off over her head. "I met Sir Alan the other night when you were having dinner with your uncle," she said. "Oh, how I loathe this whole dreary business. Men. Dancing. Coming out. And on Wednesday, fittings for our Court dresses, which cost a fortune and which we&#x2019;ll wear for one night next week, to make our curtsey to the Queen, as if it makes any difference at all to anything." She dropped the green dress heedlessly on the floor and opened her wardrobe. "What should I wear?" <p></p>"What do you want to look like?" <p></p>"I want to look like Elizabeth instead of Betsy." This was her newest enthusiasm. I found it very hard to comply with, and nobody else tried at all. "And I want to look like someone who doesn&#x2019;t need to have her parents drag home a husband for her. I swear Daddy&#x2019;s expression is just like Tigrath&#x2019;s when she&#x2019;s dragged home a mouse and dropped it proudly on my pillow." <p></p>I laughed. "Why not the cream seersucker thing with the gold ribbon we bought in Paris?" <p></p>"Because we don&#x2019;t want to look like twins," she said. "It only makes me look worse." <p></p>I smoothed the ribbon at my neck self-consciously. I can&#x2019;t help being prettier than Betsy. She never cared before Zurich. <p></p>She pulled out a forest green dress patterned with leaves so dark you could hardly see them except when the light was angled just right, another of her Paris purchases. Somebody, probably her mother, had once told Betsy that redheads ought to wear green. In my opinion it did nothing for her. "What about this?" she asked. <p></p>"What about the gray one?" I countered. It was the same cut, and almost the same fabric only in gray with the leaf pattern in black. <p></p>"I hate the gray one," she said, pulling it out. "All the same, I&#x2019;ll wear it, because I hate Sir Alan too. He&#x2019;s such a fascist." <p></p>"We&#x2019;re all fascists now, surely?" I asked. "And anyway, what&#x2019;s wrong with fascism? It&#x2019;s fun!" <p></p>"I find fascists just too sick-making," Betsy said, pulling on the gray dress and belting it viciously tight. It fell precisely just above her ankles. She looked all right. Most people are neither beautiful nor ugly, they fall somewhere in the range of the middle. If I tried, and trying was what we&#x2019;d been taught at our expensive Swiss finishing school, I could get into the top end of that range. All right was about as good as poor Betsy could manage. <p></p>I passed her her hairbrush, silver-backed with her initials engraved, a present from her father when she turned eighteen. "You&#x2019;re just saying that to be shocking. It&#x2019;s your mother makes me sick. She said I was &#x2018;not quite.&#x2019; " I tried to say it lightly, but my voice let me down. <p></p>"That&#x2019;s ghastly. To Lady B.?" Betsy asked, dragging the brush through her hair much too hard. <p></p>I nodded. "Just now. I&#x2019;d finished studying for the time being and I was coming down the stairs in search of tea and I overheard them." <p></p>"She was probably trying to make sure Sir Alan didn&#x2019;t fall for you instead of me," Betsy said. <p></p>"Oh Bets&#x2014; Elizabeth!" I said. "That&#x2019;s ridiculous. As if he&#x2019;d look at me when I&#x2019;m nobody, and about to be an undergraduate too. And anyway, he has a beard!" <p></p>"I believe it doesn&#x2019;t impede one&#x2019;s sex life," Betsy said, and we both giggled. "Do my necklace up?" <p></p>She ran her hands through the little silver box on her dressing table and fished out a thin gold chain hung with a half circle of seed pearls. I lifted her hair and fastened the clasp. It sat nicely on her skin above the neckline of the dress. "That&#x2019;s pretty," I said. "Where did you get it?" <p></p>"My aunt Patsy gave it to me. It was hers when she came out, and she felt it brought her luck. It&#x2019;s a funny length, but I like it." She straightened it. "Do you want something?" <p></p>"I&#x2019;d better not; I can&#x2019;t trust your mother not to say something if I borrow your jewelry. Besides, there&#x2019;s this ribbon." I smoothed it again. <p></p>"I&#x2019;m sure your uncle will give you something of your own soon now," Betsy said. "I expect that&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;s going to do when he takes you out on Thursday, take you to Cartier and let you choose." <p></p>"I don&#x2019;t think he has any idea I ought to have something. He has no wife, no daughters of his own, no sister even. I can&#x2019;t really tell him. He&#x2019;s been so good to me already, paying for all this nonsense, and for Oxford too," I said. "But I&#x2019;m sure that&#x2019;s not what we&#x2019;ll be doing on Thursday. That&#x2019;s our annual date to go down to Kent to look at the primroses, in memory of my father." <p></p>Betsy hugged me. "I&#x2019;d forgotten," she said. "Well, you&#x2019;re welcome to anything of mine any time, whenever Mummy isn&#x2019;t looking. Come on. We&#x2019;d better go down, or they&#x2019;ll be sending out search parties." <p></p>We went down to the drawing room together. There was a much better than normal selection of tea, several kinds of sandwiches, and a whole plate of cream cakes from Gunter&#x2019;s, as well as the usual fruitcake and digestive biscuits. I took an �clair and a cup of tea and retreated towards the wing chair by the window. Sir Alan was on the sofa by his mother, and Mr. Maynard on the other wing chair. "Cross fire," Betsy mouthed, as she cut me off from the wing chair, leaving me the place that had clearly been left for her, at the other end of the sofa. I sat there and sipped my tea. No matter how hard I tried, I thought, these people would never truly accept me. If they did, if I managed to fool some of them for a little while, someone who knew, like Mrs. Maynard, would be sure to tell them that I wasn&#x2019;t "quite." This was why I wanted to go to Oxford. Even in the little glimpse I&#x2019;d had of it so far, I could tell that standards were different; intellectual attainments still mattered more there than who your parents were. <p></p>But "not quite" had stung. I might want to turn my back on this world, I didn&#x2019;t want to be rejected by it as not good enough. I&#x2019;d made so much effort already, worrying about clothes and hair and jewelry.

Her husband died years ago, as did his wife, and in such a small town they naturally have long been aware of each other, if not exactly friends; in fact, Addie was quite fond of Louis&#x2019;s wife. His daughter, Holly, lives hours away in Colorado Springs; her son, Gene, even farther away in Grand Junction. What Addie has come to ask &#x2014; since she and Louis have been living alone for so long in houses now empty of family, and the nights are so terribly lonely &#x2014; is whether he might be willing to spend them with her, in her bed, so they can have someone to talk with.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> Elderly widow Addie Moore pays a visit to her aging widower neighbor, Louis Waters. They were never close, just knew each other peripherally, which makes the reason for this social call all the more intriguing. Addie would like to know if Louis is interested in sleeping with her. Now, now, this scenario was conceived by the late, great Kent Haruf&#x2014;<em>Our Souls at Night</em> is no <em>50 Shades of Geriatric Grey</em>. Set in the same fictional Colorado town as his National Book Award-nominated <em>Plainsong</em>, a town with its fair share of gossips, Addie and Louis embark on an unlikely friendship, an antidote to the loneliness they most exquisitely felt at night. As this friendship deepens, it is tested by said busybodies and meddling family members, plot points that almost distract from what makes this novel such a fitting and sweet swan song. <em>Our Souls at Night</em> was inspired, in part, by Haruf&#x2019;s own marriage and the intimate, late-night conversations he and his wife relished, just like Addie and Louis. And just like Addie and Louis, Haruf proved that you&#x2019;re never too old to reinvent yourself, take risks, find love, and write a great novel. <em>--Erin Kodicek</em></p>Kent Haruf&#39;s The Tie That Binds received a Whiting Foundation Award and a special citation from the PEN/Hemingway Foundation.

A small child when he comes to England on a <i>Kindertransport</i> in the summer of 1939, one Jacques Aus-terlitz is told nothing of his real family by the Welsh Methodist minister and his wife who raise him. When he is a much older man, fleeting memories return to him, and obeying an instinct he only dimly understands, he follows their trail back to the world he left behind a half century before. There, faced with the void at the heart of twentieth-century Europe, he struggles to rescue his heritage from oblivion.</p><p>If the mark of a great novel is that it creates its own world, drawing in the reader with its distinctive rhythms and reverberations, then W.G. Sebald's <i>Austerlitz</i> may be the first great novel of the new century. An unnamed narrator, resting in a waiting room of the Antwerp rail station in the late 1960s, strikes up a conversation with a student of architecture named Austerlitz, about whom he knows almost nothing. Over the next several years, the narrator often runs into his odd, engaging acquaintance by chance on his travels, until finally, after a gap of two decades, Austerlitz decides to tell the narrator the story of his life and of his search for his origins in wartime Europe. Slow and meditative, relying on the cumulative effect of its sedate, musical prose and its dark subject matter (illuminated here and there with hope), Sebald's novel doesn't overturn the conventions of fiction, but transcends them. It is a love story to history and vanished beauty. Don't let the slow beginning turn you away. <i>Austerlitz</i> takes its time getting off the ground, but is well worth seeing in flight. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Primary Directions: Astrology&#39;s Old Master Technique</h2><p>This comprehensive study explains the principles of primary directions in an accessible form, illustrating them by practical examples.

The air in the black sedan was cold and stale and, annoyingly, the driver had engaged the child safety locks so I couldn't roll down the window. We'd been stuck in the car for hours, and I was itching to get out of this moving prison and into the sun. Outside the glass, palm trees lined the road, and charming villas shared the sidewalk with weathered gray shacks advertising food, T-shirts, surfboard wax and more. Just beyond the pavement, past a strip of glistening white sand, the Pacific Ocean shimmered like a huge turquoise jewel, teasing me with its frothy waves and countless beachgoers splashing freely in the glittering water.<br><br>"Ember? Did you hear me? Answer the question, please."<br><br>I sighed and settled back against the cold leather. "Joseph and Kate Hill were killed in a car accident when we were seven years old," I recited, seeing the driver's impassive gaze watching me from the rearview mirror. Beside him, Mr. Ramsey's dark head bobbed in affirmation.<br><br>"Go on."<br><br>I squirmed against the seat belt. "They had gone to see a Broadway musical, <em>West Side Story,"</em> I continued, "and were struck by a drunk driver on the way home. My brother and I went to live with our grandparents, until Grandpa Bill developed lung cancer and could no longer take care of us. So we came here to stay with our aunt and uncle." I snuck a longing gaze out the window again, seeing a pair of humans on surfboards, gliding down the waves. My curiosity perked. I'd never gone surfing before, not in my dusty little corner of desert. It looked nearly as much fun as flying, though I doubted anything could compare to soaring the air currents, feeling the wind in your face and beneath your wings. I didn't know how I was going to survive the summer completely earthborn. Humans were lucky, I thought, as the car sped on and the surfers were lost from view. They didn't know what they were missing.<br><br>"Good," muttered Mr. Ramsey, sounding distracted. I imagined him scanning his ever-present tablet, scrolling through our files and background. "Dante, what is your real objective while in Crescent Beach?"<br><br>My twin calmly pulled his earbuds down and hit the pause button on his iPhone. He had this uncanny ability to zone out to music or television and still know exactly what was going on around him. I did not have this talent. My teachers had to smack me upside the head to get my attention if there was anything remotely distracting around. "Observe and blend in," he stated in his cool, unruffled voice. "Learn how to engage with humans, how to <em>be</em> human. Assimilate into their social structure and make them believe we are one of them."<br><br>I rolled my eyes. He caught my gaze and gave a small shrug. Dante and I weren't really twins, not in the truest sense of the word. Sure, we were the same age. Sure, we looked very similar; we had the same obscenely red hair and green eyes. And we'd been together as far back as I could remember. But we didn't come from the same womb. We didn't come from a womb at all, really. Dante and I were clutchmates, which was still highly unusual because our kind normally didn't lay more than one egg at a time. Making us strange, even among our own. But Dante and I had hatched together and were raised together, and as far as anyone was concerned, he was my twin, my sibling and my only friend.<br><br>"Mmm." Apparently satisfied that we had not, in fact, forgotten the made-up backstory drilled so deep into my head that I could recite it in my sleep, Mr. Ramsey went back to scrolling through his tablet, and I went back to staring out the window.<br><br>The ocean receded, the sparkling horizon dropping from view as we turned off the main stretch and entered a subdivision with impressive white-and-rose villas lining the streets, surrounded by perfectly manicured lawns and palm trees. Some of these dwellings were truly enormous, making me stare in amazement. I'd never seen such huge houses except on television, or in the documentaries the teachers made us watch years ago, when we were first learning about humankind. Where they lived, how they acted, their behavior and family units and language&#x2014;we'd studied it all.<br><br>Now, we would be living among them.<br><br>Excitement rose up again, making me even more impatient. I wanted out. I wanted to touch and feel and see the things beyond the glass, to finally experience it. My world, up until now, had been a large underground facility that I never saw the outside of, then a private school in the middle of the Great Basin, with no one around for miles, and only my brother and teachers for company. Safe, protected, far from prying human eyes...and possibly the most boring spot on the face of the planet. I squirmed against the seat again, accidentally hitting the back of the chair in front of me.<br><br>"Ember," Mr. Ramsey said, a note of irritation in his voice,<br><br>"sit still."<br><br>Scowling, I settled back, crossing my arms. <em>Sit still, calm down, be quiet.</em> The most familiar phrases in my life. I was never good at sitting in one place for long periods of time, though my teachers had tried their hardest to instill "a little patience" into me. <em>Patience,</em> stodgy Mr. Smith had told me on more than one occasion, <em>is a virtue that holds especially true for your kind. The best-laid plans are never conceived in a day. You have the luxury of time&#x2014;time to think, time to plan, time to calculate and see everything come to fruition. Talon has survived for centuries, and will continue to survive, because it knows the value of patience. So what's the blasted hurry, hatchling?</em><br><br>I rolled my eyes. The "blasted hurry" was that I rarely had any time that was truly my own. They wanted me to sit, listen, learn, be quiet, when I wanted to run, shout, jump, fly. Everything in my life was rules: can't do this, don't do that, be here at this time, follow the instructions to the letter. It had gotten worse as I got older, every tiny detail of my life regulated and laid out for me, until I was ready to explode. The only thing that had kept me from going completely nuts was looking forward to the day I turned sixteen. The day I would "graduate" from that isolated corner of no-man's-land and, if I was deemed <em>ready,</em> begin the next stage of training. I'd done everything I could to be "ready" for this, and it must've paid off because here we were. <em>Observe, assimilate and blend in,</em> that was our official mission, but all I cared about was that I was out of school and away from Talon. I'd finally get to see the world I'd studied all my life.<br><br>The sedan finally pulled into a cul-de-sac of smaller but no less elegant villas and rolled to a stop in front of a driveway in the very center. I peered through the window and grinned with excitement at the place that would be home for an indefinite length of time.<br><br>The structure looming above us sat across a tiny lawn of short grass, scrub and a single palm tree encircled in brick. Its walls were a cheerful, buttery yellow, the tiled roof a deep red. The top floor had huge glass windows that caught the afternoon light, and the front door stood beneath an archway, like the entrance to a castle, I thought. But best of all, through the gap between the house and its neighbor, I could just make out the silvery glint of water, and my heart leaped at the thought of the ocean right in our backyard.<br><br>I wanted nothing more than to yank open the door, jump out and go sprinting down the sand dunes until I hit the ocean waiting for me at the bottom. But Mr. Ramsey, our official escort for the day, turned in his seat to eye us, particularly me, as if he knew what was going through my mind. "Wait here," he said, his rather large nostrils flaring with the order. "I will inform your guardians you have arrived. Do not move until I return."<br><br>He opened his door, letting in a brief, intoxicating rush of warmth and salt-drenched air, slammed it behind him and marched up the worn brick path to the waiting villa.<br><br>I drummed my fingers against the leather seat and squirmed.<br><br>"Wow," Dante breathed, peering over my shoulder, craning his neck to see the whole house. I could feel his presence behind me, his hand on my back as he steadied himself. "So, it's finally happening," he said in a low voice. "No more private school, no more getting up at 6:00 a.m. every single day, no more being stuck in the middle of nowhere."<br><br>"No classes, no study hall, no evaluators dropping by every month to see how 'human' we are." I grinned back at him. The driver was watching us, listening to us, but I didn't care. "Sixteen years, and we finally get to start our lives. We're finally free."<br><br>My twin chuckled. "I wouldn't go that far," he murmured, gently tugging a strand of my short red hair. "Remember, we're here to blend in, to study the humans and assimilate into the community. This is just another phase of training. Don't forget, at the end of the summer, we start our sophomore year of high school. But more important, our real instructors will show up, and they'll decide where we fit into the organization. This is a brief respite, at most, so enjoy it while you can."<br><br>I made a face at him. "I intend to."<br><br>And I did. He had no idea how much. I was tired of rules and isolation, of watching the world go by without me. I was tired of Talon and their endless string of policies, laws and restrictions. No more of that. The summer was mine, and I had big plans, things I wanted to do, before it ended and we'd be forced back into the system. This summer, I was going to live.<br><br><em>If</em> I was ever allowed out of this stupid car.<br><br>The front door opened again, and Mr. Ramsey waved us forward. But instead of disengaging the child locks, the driver himself got out of the sedan and opened the doors for us. Of course he let Dante out first, and I almost slid across the seat to exit the car behind him. I was literally bouncing with impatience by the time the driver walked around to my side and <em>finally</em> let me out.<br><br>When my feet hit the ground, I stretched both arms over my head and yawned, breathing in the sun-soaked air, letting it warm my skin. I already loved how this place smelled. Ocean and sand, surf and hot pavement, the sound of distant waves caressing the beach. I wondered what Mr. Ramsey and my future guardians would say if I blew them all off and went skipping down to the ocean without looking back.<br><br>"Ember! Dante!" Mr. Ramsey stood in the shade of the archway, beckoning to us. I sighed and had taken one step toward the trunk to get my bags when the driver stopped me.<br><br>"I'll bring in your luggage, Miss Ember," he said solemnly. "You go on up to the house."<br><br>"Are you sure? I can get it." I stepped forward, holding out a hand, and he cringed back, averting his eyes. I blinked and stopped, remembering that some humans in the organization&#x2014;the ones who actually knew what we were&#x2014;were afraid of us. Our teachers had told us as much; though we were civilized and had slipped perfectly into human society, we were still predators, higher up on the food chain, and they knew it.<br><br>"Come on, sis," Dante called as I stepped back. He stood at the edge of the walkway with his hands in his pockets, the sun gleaming off his crimson hair. He already looked perfectly at home. "The sooner we meet everyone, the sooner we can do what we want."<br><br>That sounded good to me. I nodded and followed him up the walk to Mr. Ramsey, who ushered us into a charming, well-lit living room. Through the large bay windows off to the side, I could see a rickety picket fence and, beyond that, the beach, a long wooden dock and the ever-tempting ocean. A pair of humans stood in front of a green leather sofa as we came in, waiting for us.<br><br>"Ember, Dante," Mr. Ramsey said, nodding to the pair, "this is your aunt Sarah and uncle Liam. They'll be taking care of you until further notice."<br><br>"Nice to meet you," Dante, ever the polite one, said, while I hung back and observed our new guardians curiously. With a few distinctions, all humans looked basically the same to me. But our teachers had instructed us that it was crucial to see the differences, to recognize the individual, so I did that now. "Uncle" Liam was lanky and wind-burned, with russet hair and a neatly trimmed beard peppered with white. He had a stern face and unsmiling, swamp-water eyes that swept over us critically, before he gave a short, brisk nod. "Aunt" Sarah was plump and cheerful looking, her brown hair pulled into a neat bun, her dark eyes watching us with hawklike intensity.<br><br>"Well," Mr. Ramsey said, tucking his tablet under an arm. "My job here is done. I'll have Murray deliver your bags to your rooms. Mr. O'Conner, you know who to call if there is an emergency. Ember, Dante." He nodded to us, fixing me with a firm glare. "Obey your guardians. Remember your training. Your evaluators will be in to check on you in three months."<br><br>And, just like that, he swept from the room, out the front door and was gone. He didn't say goodbye, and we hadn't expected him to. Sentiment was not a big thing among our kind.<br><br>"Ember and Dante Hill, welcome to your new home," Uncle Liam announced, sounding like he'd done this speech before. He probably had. "I'm sure your instructors have informed you of the rules, but let me remind you, in case you forgot. While you are here, Sarah and I are your guardians, thus we are responsible for you. Meals are served at 8:00 a.m., noon and 6:30 p.m. You are not required to be home for mealtimes, but you are to call to let us know where you are. You should already have the numbers memorized, so there is no excuse not to. Talon has provided you with a vehicle&#x2014;I understand you both have driver's licenses&#x2014;but you must ask permission before taking it out. Curfew is strictly at midnight, no exceptions, no questions asked. And, of course, the most important rule." His green-gray eyes narrowed. "Under no circumstances are you to Shift into your true forms. And you are <em>never</em> to fly, for any reason whatsoever. With the amount of people, technology and hidden threats, the risk of being seen is far too great. Your old school was on Talon property and they controlled the airspace around it, so the risks were minimal if you needed to Shift, but that is not the case here. Unless you receive a direct order from Talon itself, flying around in your true forms is strictly, one hundred percent forbidden. Is that understood?"<br><br>I managed a brief nod, though the thought made me physically ill. How did they expect me to never fly again? They might as well just tear my wings off.<br><br>"If you fail to comply with these rules," Liam continued, "or if we deem you unfit for human society, Talon will be informed at once, and you will be evaluated to see if reeducation is necessary. Other than that, you are free to come and go as you please. Do you have any questions?"<br><br>I did. I might be completely earthbound, but that didn't mean I had to stay here. "So, the beach," I said, and he arched an eyebrow at me. "Can we go down there any time?"<br><br>Sarah chuckled. "It's a public beach, Ember. As long as you're home by curfew, you can spend as much time down there as you want. In fact, it's a good place to meet the locals&#x2014;a lot of kids your age go there to hang out." She turned, beckoning to us with a chubby hand.

Thomsen writes of the collapse that brought Bill to the verge of death and of the luminous instant of insight that saved him. This turning point led Bill to the encounter in 1935 with Dr. Bob and the start of what was to be a new beginning for countless others who despaired of finding rescue and redemption. <p>Every night at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings around the world, a speaker says, "Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now."

His colourful work, Lives of the Twelve Caesars, is, along with Tacitus, the major source for the period from Julius Caesar to Domitian. He sets out in vivid detail a great range of aspects illuminating the emperor&#39;s characters, their habits, from table to bedchamber - their intrigues, their loves and their deaths. Himself a court official, he quotes from a variety of sources, from the official and private documents as well as from old anecdotes, gossip, songs and jokes, giving an unparalleled oblique view of his subjects. Long familiar to students of classics, he found a new audience as the main source for Robert Graves&#39; novels and the subsequent television series I, Claudius.</p><p>Tom Griffith has also translated Plato&#39;s The Republic, Symposium, Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, and Phaedrus.While his histories are rich with the details of each Caesar's reign, what makes Suetonius's work particularly interesting are the subjective elements: his character portraits, lurid asides, and open evaluations of each Caesar as good, bad, or flat-out immoral. Derek Jacobi's narration fits this approach marvelously. His delivery is clear, even brisk, when reviewing the factual data, but he lingers over the more personal judgmental elements. Through Jacobi, Suetonius's outrage over what is done to his beloved Rome comes through as both heartfelt and personal. Jacobi brings this history to vivid, dramatic life.

Sondheim's creative genius has shaped the contemporary musical, and Zadan interweaves comments by Sondheim's colleagues with a wealth of information about the shows to display the composer's enormous talent. As in the first edition, the focus is on Sondheim's career and accomplishments, and biography is skimpy, except for some isolated, tantalizing facts. But no matter; the detail about the process of putting together a show, plus the profuse illustrations and appendixes containing production information, etc., add up to required reading for all musical theater lovers.

In 1990, her skeleton was found, virtually complete, in what many call the most spectacular dinosaur fossil discovery to date. <p>And then another battle began--a "Survival of the Fittest" free-for-all involving commercial dinosaur hunters, gun-toting law officers, an ambitious federal prosecutor, a Native American tribe, jealous academics, an enterprising auction house, major museums, and corporate giants, all making their claim for the dinosaur named Sue (after the field paleontologist who first spotted her bones). At stake: not just Sue's wealth of scientific riches, but her grant-drawing power and vast commercial potential as well. </p><p>Before it was over, there would be claims and counterclaims; charges of checkbook-polluted science, criminal larceny, and vengeful prosecutions; and devastating prison terms. And the gavel would come down on the largest-ever ($8.36 million) auction price tag for a fossil, paid by Chicago's Field Museum, with help from Disney and McDonald's. </p><p>Now, as her May, 2000, museum unveiling nears, Sue is not only poised to be a scientific phenomenon but a main attraction at Disney's Animal Kingdom and (fittingly enough for the world's greatest meat eater) a marketing superstar for McDonald's. Meanwhile, the man whose team actually unearthed Sue--professional dinosaur hunter Peter Larson--remains hauntingly, touchingly obsessed with the 41-foot-long, dead-for-millions-of-years <i>T-rex</i>. </p><p>Sue is not just another dinosaur, and <i>Tyrannosaurus Sue</i> is not just another dinosaur book. It is a fascinating introduction to the centuries-old history of commercial fossil hunting, a legal thriller, and a provocative look at academic versus commercial science and the chase for the money that fuels both. And, in the case of Peter Larson, through whose eyes most of the story is revealed, a kind of love story. Steve Fiffer, an attorney as well as an author who has followed the story for the past seven years, has captured the whole range of characters and issues embroiled in the fight for Sue. Ranging the prehistoric Badlands to the hallowed halls of justice, academia, and merchandising tie-ins, Fiffer communicates both the excitement over Sue's discovery <i>and</i> the motivations, maneuverings, and absurdities of the various forces attempting to control her destiny.</p></p><p>How much is that T. Rex in the window? Journalist Steve Fiffer looks at the most contentious paleontological find ever in <i>Tyrannosaurus Sue</i>. This scientific, sociological, and legal study is entertaining and insightful, highlighting the personalities of the researchers, attorneys, and tribal and federal authorities who struggled for years over the ownership rights to the best-preserved Rex specimen yet found. From its discovery in South Dakota in 1990 by Susan Hendrickson and Peter Larson through the tortuous court cases to decide its fate to the final auction at Sotheby's, Fiffer finds just the right words to describe the action, a difficult task given the conflicting reports of contesting witnesses. Professional jealousy and academic elitism (or concern for valuable scientific material and Indian property rights) led to accusations of illegal collecting and the seizure of the skeleton by federal agents shortly after its move to Larson's Black Hills Institute. Suits, countersuits, and indictments escalated the struggle into an all-out war with vast sums of money and professional reputations at stake. In the end, Larson was imprisoned as an example to illegal collectors despite his sincere belief that he had worked within the law, and Sue was awarded to property owner Maurice Williams and purchased for $8 million by Chicago's Field Museum with the assistance of the McDonald's and Disney corporations. <i>Tyrannosaurus Sue</i> is a riveting tale, well-written and just unsettling enough to provoke thought and discussion. --<i>Rob Lightner</i>"A blow-by-blow account for control of the world's most famous dinosaur--real tour de force!" <br>--Kenneth Carpenter, Department of Earth Sciences, Denver Museum of Natural History <p> "For more than 65 million years, Sue rested in her Cretaceous coffin. She awoke to a world of legal battles and rivalry as fierce in their way as anything she faced when alive. Steve Fiffer tells her compelling story as well as it could be told. This book is a must for anyone with even the slightest interest in the interplay between science and the law." <br>--Dr. James L. Powell, President and Director, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History </p><p> "A century after the Great Bone Wars of Cope and Marsh hit the headlines, Sue emerged from the earth--only to become embroiled in another <i>fin de siecle</i> fossil fiasco. Steve Fiffer relates Sue's fascinating story with flair, and with sensitivity to those who took part in the saga." <br>--Blake Edgar, editor of <i>Dinosaur Digs</i> and co-author of <i>From Lucy to Language</i> </p><p> "Steve Fiffer has written a lively, must-read book that untangles the complexities of the 'story of Sue' for all of those interested in something that can never happen again.

Who put the coins in a hiding place behind the wall?</p><p>The Boxcar Children Series was created by Gertrude Chandler Warner, a teacher, when she realized that there were few, if any, books for children that were both easy and fun to read. She drew on her own experiences in writing the mysteries. As a child, she had spent hours watching trains near her home, and often dreamed about what it would be like to live in a caboose or freight car.

But his nature and love poetry have left their mark on several generations of modern poets, from the Beats to Denise Levertov, Carolyn Forche, and Jessica Hagedorn. A complex person, Rexroth was a self-taught man of great knowledge, a consummate storyteller, a man who could be thoroughly charming one day and who could take your head off the next. In the definitive and only biography, Linda Hamalian explores Rexroth&#39;s life and work in all their depth.In this first full-length biography, richly detailed and thoroughly documented, the self-taught Rexroth emerges as a major American poet. Rexroth, a prominent figure in San Francisco's literary renaissance, was also a jazz-poet performer, translator, mentor, critic, leftist commentator, pacifist, Catholic-Buddhist spiritualist, world traveler, wit, and iconoclast. Hamalian depicts the virtues and flaws of this fascinating man with cool, even-handed balance. Married four times, and father to two daughters, he yearned to understand and fulfill the lives of the women close to him. Longing for stable relationships, he sometimes abused, exploited, and alienated others, then accused them of deserting him. He bowed to no authority, but his bravado often shielded hidden insecurities. He took great delight in nature's beauty, but in his poems life and art often diverged. With its multifaceted portrait, rendered with photographic accuracy, this instructive book augments our appreciation of the man and his era. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Addie Lee Bracy, Beaver Coll.

For her twelfth birthday, Hills Aunt Pansy had one of her stories published in a book of short stories. This was the beginning of Hills career as a writer. In 1886, Hill and her family moved to Winter Park, Florida, where she got a job teaching gymnastics at a local college. She wrote her first real book there, in an effort to raise money for a family vacation to Chautauqua Lake. The book was called Chatauqua Idyl and was published in 1887 by D. Lothrop and Company, the same publisher that printed her first story when she was twelve. Hill was eventually married and began a family, but lost her husband to appendicitis. At this point in her life, her writing was the only means she had to keep food on the table and money in her pockets. In her lifetime, Hill wrote over a hundred books, only two of which were non-fiction.

Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made "The Bell Jar" a haunting American classic. <p>This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</p></p><p>Plath was an excellent poet but is known to many for this largely autobiographical novel. <b>The Bell Jar</b> tells the story of a gifted young woman's mental breakdown beginning during a summer internship as a junior editor at a magazine in New York City in the early 1950s. The real Plath committed suicide in 1963 and left behind this scathingly sad, honest and perfectly-written book, which remains one of the best-told tales of a woman's descent into insanity.A vulnerable young girl wins a dream assignment on a big-time New York fashion magazine and finds herself plunged into a nightmare. An autobiographical account of Sylvia Plath's own mental breakdown and suicide attempt, <i>The Bell Jar</i> is more than a confessional novel, it is a comic but painful statement of what happens to a woman's aspirations in a society that refuses to take them seriously... a society that expects electroshock to cure the despair of a sensitive, questioning young artist whose search for identity becomes a terrifying descent toward madness. <p>"A fine novel, as bitter and remorseless as her last poems -- the kind of book Salinger's Fanny might have written about herself ten years later, if she had spent those ten years in Hell." -- Robert Scholes, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. </p><p>"By turns funny, harrowing, crude, ardent and artless.

Expanding the principles of that book, <i>Rise Above</i> promises to deliver readers from what Shamblin calls the "bondage" of food. Rather than offering a simple diet plan, Shamblin addresses the spiritual root causes of overeating and admonishes her readers to serious introspection. "We are not lacking for information now," Shamblin explains, "we are hurting for <i>motivation</i> and heart-changing cultivation." Shamblin helps readers find motivation to master their cravings for food by reminding them of God's desire to control every aspect of life. "You may eat anything," she writes, "but you are not to be mastered by anything, for 'you are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body' (1 Cor. 6:19b-20)." Shamblin, a registered dietician, conveys her nutritional expertise and her spiritual conviction in every chapter of this straightforward, commonsensical, Bible-based book.Shamblin follows The Weigh Down Diet with more encouragement for the 50% of Americans she declares are overweight. Shamblin's cure for overeating has two dimensions: physiological (eat only when you are hungry and stop eating when you're full) and spiritual (replace your passion for food with a passion for God). In this book, the spiritual dimension takes center stage. Shamblin's tone is unfailingly motivational as she utilizes the Bible to exhort readers to serve "The God" instead of "the food god." (She also addresses, not entirely satisfactorily, a wide range of other potential addictions, from overspending while shopping to indulging in pornography.) Shamblin is sometimes strangely dismissive of scientific research on the benefits of a balanced diet, but she plainly states what most diet books do not: that our relationship to food is a profoundly spiritual matter, not just an issue of calories, fat grams and carbohydrates. This conviction makes ancient biblical stories like the Exodus come to life in new ways, albeit with the help of a breezy style that sails by perennial problems in Christian theology with unflagging cheer. For example, Shamblin notes that America, a nation of "professional dieters," is enslaved by its obsession with weight loss. God can free us from the "Egypt" of this enslavement if we replace our love of food with love for God. Readers will have to go elsewhere to plumb the depths of such spiritual issues as idolatry, self-denial and the relationship of human works to God's grace--but here they will find excellent entry-level help for what is arguably America's least recognized spiritual problem. $500,000 ad/promo; 30-city author tour. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sweet Scented Rose: A Treasury of Verse and Prose</h2><p>Sheila Pickles devotes an entire book to the queen of flowers, sharing her favorite tributes to the most popular and beloved blossoms.

For Bruce Berger it has been more. In <i>Almost an Island</i>, he takes readers beyond the Baja of guidebooks and offers a wildly entertaining look at the real Baja California.<br><br> Eight hundred miles long, Baja California is the remotest region of the Sonoran desert, a land of volcanic cliffs, glistening beaches, fantastical boojum trees, and some of the greatest primitive murals in the Western Hemisphere. In<i> Almost an Island</i>, Berger recounts tales from his three decades in this extraordinary place, enriching his account with the peninsula's history, its politics, and its probable future&#x2014;rendering a striking panorama of this land so close to the United States, so famous, and so little known.<br><br> Readers will meet a cast of characters as eccentric as the place itself: Brandy, who ranges the desert in a sand buggy while breathing from an oxygen tank; Katie, the chanteuse; nuns illegally raising pigs. They will encounter the tourist madness of a total eclipse, the story of the heir to an oasis, a musical Mata Hari, rare pronghorn antelope, and a pet tarantula. In prose as glittering as this desert engulfed by the sea, <i>Almost an Island</i> is a fascinating journey into the human heart of a spectacular land.</p><p>Bruce Berger is the author of<i> There Was a River</i>&nbsp;and <i>The Telling Distance</i>, which won a Western States Book Award and a Colorado Authors Award. He lives in a three-room cabin in Aspen, Colorado, and spends part of each year in Baja California. In addition to writing, has also played the piano professionally both in the United States and in Spain.While the natural marvels of the 800-mile-long Mexican peninsula called Baja California are not scanted in this freewheeling exploration, it's the human inhabitants that underscore its uniqueness. Berger, award-winning author of The Telling Distance (1990), erstwhile piano player ready for adventure, chronicles his three-decade love affair with this timeless landscape of desert, lagoons, caves and remote ranges, as well as the people of its cities and towns. One of those cities is LaPaz in Baja California Sur, to which a third of the book is devoted. ("LaPaz was one of those places that bored the tourist while whispering to a struck minority: here you must live.") As a resident foreigner whose affection does not close his eyes to contemporary societal evils, Berger is an objective observer. As a "specialist in the state of Baja California," he treats the reader to a pithy history of the upper and lower peninsula, with views of the Spanish colonizers, the controversial missionaries, especially the Jesuits, and the ongoing flinty relationship of the U.S. and this Mexican territory. Berger the raconteur entertains as he cautions against the intrusions made possible by paved roads and highways. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sacred Magic Of Ancient Egypt: The Spiritual Practice Restored</h2><p><p>In <em>The Sacred Magic of Ancient Egypt</em>, Rosemary Clark presents a comprehensive guide to a modern practice of ancient Egyptian theurgy.

Her continuing study in this field derives from a thirty-year background in historical research, travel throughout the Middle East, and the development of a repertoire of unique skills in recreating Egyptian ceremony and rituals. She has been a featured speaker on several tours of Egypt, and has acted as coordinator for on-site devotional temple activities. Ms. Clark served as exhibit leader for the Tutankhamun tour when it came to Chicago in 1977, and illustrated The Traveler&#x2019;s Key to Ancient Egypt (New York: Knopf, 1985). She has appeared on NBC television in a feature broadcast on her work as founder of Temple Harakhte, a group of men and women devoted to the experiential religious practices of Egypt&#x2019;s Old Kingdom. Above and beyond offering a thorough knowledge of Egyptian history and mythology, Clark is well versed in the hieroglyphic script, its transliteration and the translation of ancient texts, and in the nuances of Hermetic philosophy and Sacred Science. <br><b>Chapter One <br>The Legacy <br>of Ancient Egypt <br></b><i>We shall omit from our history the stories invented by Herodotus and <br>certain other writers on the affairs of Egypt, who deliberately prefer fables to facts, and who spin yarns merely for the purpose of amusement. We shall, however, set forth the things written by the priests of Egypt in their sacred records, which we have examined diligently and minutely. <br></i>&#x2015;Diodorus Siculus: <i>Bibliotheca Historica, </i>Book I: 69 <br>The story of Khaemwas, though written of events more than 3,000 years ago, still evokes our fascination with the mystic legacy of Egypt. It speaks of an arcane doctrine believed to be lost, of mysteries buried by time. We know that in ancient times, despite hardships we can only imagine, the established spiritual traditions endowed people with the guidance and skills needed to understand the powers of their environment and live in harmony with them. But we seem not to be so equipped in the modern age, despite the advances of science and industry. <br> <br>This is undoubtedly why we look to past cultures like Egypt for the elusive powers and insights we miss. We are in many ways the same as Khaemwas&#x2015;we desire to know our sacred heritage, to understand the secrets that everyday life conceals from us, and to discover the source of all wisdom. For these reasons, Egypt&#x2019;s mystic legacy continues to summon our interest. <br> <br>What is this legacy of which so many ancients spoke? The Egyptians freely <br>passed their legends on to travelers, as the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus <br>(60 b.c.e.) noted. And similar narratives were consistently repeated in the literature and monumental writing of the temples and tombs. The legends pertained to their gods, royal persons, sages, and adventurers&#x2015;beings who embodied the natural and supernatural forces of the world around them. Most were chronicles of metaphysical events, handed down from antiquity. But they differed from the myths of other cultures, including the Greeks, who viewed this heritage as symbolic or metaphorical imagery of natural phenomena and the universe, not factual events. The ancient Egyptians were not so philosophically rigid; they made no distinctions between legend and myth. The chronicles they inherited from antiquity were believed to be real occurrences, taking place either at an historical time when their gods inhabited the Earth or in a dimension they called &#x201c;timeless time,&#x201d; when divine powers are directly accessible by human beings. By virtue of this, their legends were both vital and practical, because they infused past, present, <br>and future with meaning and purpose. <br> <br>Moreover, Egypt&#x2019;s narrative legacy embraces far more than the exploits of <br>the gods and the acts they performed to create the manifest world. Within them are contained the canons of their art, architecture, language, and ritual&#x2015;the foundations of a tradition that sustained their cultural existence for thousands of years.1 This is probably the most powerful dimension of Egypt&#x2019;s legacy, because it appears to have defined the overall goals and mandates of her society&#x2015;from the farm worker and fisherman to the scribe and temple priestess, and ultimately, to the seat of all temporal power, the Royal House. In all these realms, spirituality and science coalesced to produce a body of metaphysical knowledge that formed the underpinnings of Egyptian civilization. <br> <br>Is it possible to retrieve this wisdom? Many have posed this question over the ages, and some of the answers have been discovered in the literary heritage of the Egyptians. Firstly, the ancient Egyptians did not see a rift between the workings of the divine and mundane spheres. The sacred encompassed the secular in their world view; the physical world&#x2015;including natural phenomena and the plant and animal kingdoms&#x2015;was seen as a reflection of the divine world, and everything in it possessed a divine nature. <br> <br>The gods manifested through the visible &#x2015;human beings, trees, stars, wind and storm, even though these living things possessed an identity of their own as well. If we could express the essence of Egyptian philosophy over the thousands of years it existed, it would indisputably reflect this doctrine. A sacred text from the time of Rameses II describes this immanence <br>of divinity in nature: <br><i>The soul of Shu is the air, the soul of Neheh is the rain, <br>The soul of Ra is the primeval ocean. <br>The soul of Asar is the ram of Mendes, <br>The soul of Sobekh is the crocodile. <br>The soul of every god resides in serpents, <br>The soul of Ra is found throughout the land. <br></i>&#x2015;<i>The Book of the Celestial Cow, </i>Dynasty 19 <br>Secondly, the unity of the lifestreams, drawn together by divine vitality, is also described in many of the sacred texts at temples, tombs, and on ancient papyri&#x2015; and they disclose more than a glimpse of this doctrine. Unification of the soul with the gods and natural life was a vital approach to one&#x2019;s spiritual identity. An early funerary inscription delineates these associations succinctly: <br><i>If I live or pass on, I am Asar. <br>I enter you and appear through you, <br>I decay in you, I spring forth from you, <br>I descend in you, I repose on my side. <br>The gods are living in me, <br>As I live and grow in the emmer that sustains the exalted ones. <br></i>&#x2015;Coffin Text #330 <br> <br>These beliefs were fundamental in their world view, but the mandate that arose from them was just as essential. Maintenance of the unity created by these relationships occupied the time and resources of all members of Egyptian society in a form that we most associate with Egypt&#x2015;sacred ritual. <br> <br>This activity was performed in a clearly prescribed canon on all levels of society, and generally unaltered over the course of thousands of years of recorded history. Its consistency and continuity was based on another important belief&#x2015;that their rituals were recreations of the acts of divine beings when life arose in the beginning of time. And the performance of rites was regarded not only as a high calling, but a spiritual exchange that offered countless benefits to the participant: <br><i>To the prophets, divine fathers, priests, and lectors <br>And all who enter Amun&#x2019;s temple of Ipet Sout: <br>By performing the rites and making the offerings, <br>By doing the service of the month priest, <br>The great god will give you life. <br>You will be flawless in his presence, <br>You will be fortified with his blessings. <br></i>&#x2015;Inscription on the statue of Harwa, Dynasty 25 <br> <br><b>The Worlds of Creation <br></b>In Egyptian cosmology, the forces of creation are mirrored in nature&#x2015;they are both transcendent and cyclic. In this view, all of the lifestreams, including human beings, nature, and the gods, partake of a process that ordains a return to the creative source and a reappearance in the phenomenal world, in a perpetual cycle of renewal, called <i>Neheh </i>(&#x201c;forever,&#x201d; &#x201c;eternity&#x201d;). <br> <br>Returning to the world of creation was a theme continually emphasized in <br>the liturgies of the temple and tomb. The powers that brought the deity into the temple were believed to originate even beyond the sway of divine beings, yet they could be harnessed to bring human beings into the realm of the gods. This return was not only possible, but an inevitability of mortal existence because humans, natural forces, and even the gods were subject to the cyclic forces that operate in the creative realms. <br> <br>In the temple, the worlds of creation were ever present. On approaching the <br>holy precinct, a <i>temenos </i>wall emulated the primeval ocean, from which life arose in the beginning of time. Passing through the portals to the house of the god, entry into the sphere of creative powers was indicated by forests of soaring columns that mirrored the initial appearance of life in the form of aquatic plants. And on entering the temple proper, the foundation of the material world was depicted in artistic representations of divine beings manifesting their nature through acts of creation in the physical world&#x2015;the birth of royal persons, the initiation of natural laws and cycles, and the establishment of order in society. <br><b>Photo 2&#x2015;</b>The colonnade of the Temple of Auset in Philae, emulating the primeval marshes <br>of creation (Graeco-Roman ca. 250 b.c.e.). <br>In the tomb, the deceased returned to the creative powers in nature and the universe with scenes of hunting in the primeval marsh, where life proliferates and renews the soul. But this new phase of existence was not limited to those who passed from mortal life to new life in the immortal worlds. The living were bonded and renewed by these powers as well, and were welcomed into the field of creation by participating in the same ritual processes that inaugurated the new existence for their departed ones. <br> <br>In the Egyptian universe, the cosmogenesis was not defined by one episode. <br>Rather, it was seen as a cyclic process in rhythmic phases, where four dimensions exist, interpenetrate, and interact through time and space. <br>In the first phase, the world of <i>Manu </i>(&#x201c;horizon of waters&#x201d;) comes into being as the macrocosm or celestial sphere, from which the elements of creation emerge. Its image is a watery mass of undefined powers, where all possibilities are articulated, but not manifest. <br> <br>In the second phase, the world of <i>Aakhut </i>(&#x201c;luminous horizon&#x201d;) appears, in <br>the fiery form of light that illuminates the primeval waters and impels patterns or forms to come into being. <br> <br>In the third phase, the world of <i>Rostau </i>(&#x201c;horizon of spirits&#x201d;) comes into being, symbolized as a mound upon which the forces of the upper worlds come to rest. This phase expresses the containment of the sacred fire in matter, the genesis of material life in microcosmic form. <br> <br>The last phase of creation, the world of <i>Ament </i>(&#x201c;horizon of the west&#x201d;) represents <br>the phenomenal world that we experience, where cyclic forces govern the <br>conditions of existence&#x2015;birth and death. Here, the return to the upper worlds becomes possible, as this realm expresses the fulfillment of the creative forces as well as their predestination for cyclic renewal. This world also possesses the mechanisms for the mutation of the physical form, which make possible the conscious experience of moving through several phases of existence. <br><i>Manu (Water) <br></i>Horizon of the waters <br><i>Rostau (Earth) <br></i>Horizon of spirits <br><i>Ament (Air) <br></i>Horizon of the west <br><i>Aakhut (Fire) <br></i>Luminous horizon <br><b>Figure 2&#x2015;The Names of the Worlds of Creation <br></b>The four creative realms embody the elemental forms of the ancient universe: <br>Water (Manu), Fire (Aakhut), Earth (Rostau), and Air (Ament). As such, <br>they do not represent conflicting or alternate themes of the cosmogenesis, but stages of manifest reality that exist interdependently. Each world possesses a creator who proliferates particular functions that interact with the others, and each has an equally significant influence on the world of human life. <br> <br>In these four worlds of creation, the Egyptians saw certain universal functions come into being as divinities, the <i>Neteru </i>(&#x201c;gods&#x201d; or &#x201c;divine principles,&#x201d; the <i>Neter </i>being the individual deity of a place or action).2 The Neteru represent universal forces that organize and maintain the life of creation. They also perform specific functions both in their natural realms and in the world that we experience. <br> <br>Hence, families of gods are depicted who govern processes in nature, in the <br>human body, and in the phenomena of the sky&#x2015;much of which brought confusion to many observers of Egyptian culture in ancient times. But each group of divinities conveys a comprehensive view of a reality that has both cosmological and mundane wisdom. <br> <br>The principles that each creative family represents were articulated in distinctive philosophical schools that possessed unique imagery and temple traditions in ancient Egypt. The cosmogony of Hermopolis in Middle Egypt was one of the earliest, expressing the creative powers in the world of Manu as an <i>ogdoad, </i>or group of eight divinities (Nun and Naunet, Huh and Hauhet, Kuk and Kauket, Maat and Djehuti) who bring the elemental forms of life into being. Here, the creator is Nun, the primeval waters, who brings forth life from the darkness by stirring and speaking the creative utterance. Another group of divine powers, the Solar Triad (Ra, Khepri, and Sopdet), stems from archaic times. It is associated with the world of Manu by its imagery of creative beings in barques that cross the primeval ocean <br>cyclically. These powers circulate the elemental forms of life through the universal landscape in epochs of time. In this family, the creator is Ra, the Sun god, who precipitates life via light or illumination into the dark waters of Nun. <br> <br>The world of Aakhut is represented by the triad of Memphis (Ptah, Sekhmet- Bast, and Nefertum) where the creator is Ptah, the artificer who fabricates life forms through thought. In this world also operates the triad of Esna (Khnum, Neit, and Heka), who fuse the light of creation to these thought forms, evoking the patterns of life that come into being in the material world. The creatrix of this family is Neit, the androgynous &#x201c;mother-father&#x201d; of the gods who infuses elemental substance with vitality. Of Khnum, he is depicted as the &#x201c;fashioner&#x201d; of the material form, and his powers extend from the immaterial world of fire into the visible realms: <br><i>He fashioned mankind and engendered the gods, <br>All live by that which emanates from him. <br>. . . his manifestations are hidden among people, <br>They constitute all beings, since the time of the gods. <br></i>&#x2015;Temple of Khnum, Ptolemaic Dynasty <br> <br><b>Figure 3&#x2015;The World of Manu <br>The Hermopolitan <br>Ogdoad <br>The Solar Triad <br></b>Nun Naunet <br>Sopdet Ra <br>Khepri <br>Kuk Kauket <br>Huh Hauhet <br>Maat Djehuti <br><b>Figure 4&#x2015;The World of Aakhut <br></b>The world of Rostau represents the organic world of creation, where the <i>ennead </i>(group of nine) of Heliopolis govern the processes of physical manifestation (Atum, Shu and Tefnut, Nut and Geb, Asar and Auset, Set and Nebt-Het). <br>Atum is the creator who proliferates by spitting or ejaculating to bring forth his divine progeny. They are followed by the triad of Dendera, which rouses the creative powers within the manifest form (Het-Her, Heru, and Ihy). They are completed by the Funerary Quaternary (Imset, Daumutef, Qebsenuf, and Haapi), which transmits the creative impulse from one form to another. And in the world of Ament, the triad of Thebes governs the processes that mature and complete physical life (Amun, Mut, and Khons). <br> <br>The head in this realm is Amun, the invisible breath of creation. They share their functions with the Initiatory Triad (Heru Ur, Sokar, and Anpu), who refine the cosmic elements in the corporeal body, and the Cyclic Triad (Taurt, Hapi, and Apep), which brings completion to periodic processes and renewal in new realms. <br> <br>Altogether, the four worlds of creation are constituted by ten families of <br>Neteru, who represent the principles of creative manifestation and embody the functions of the phenomenal world. Forty-two divinities inhabit this landscape, and express the mystic forces of Egypt&#x2019;s religious pantheon. <br> <br><b>The Memphite Triad The Esna Triad <br></b>Ptah Sekhmet-Bast Neit <br>Nefertum Heka <br>Khnum <br>1.

Although a basic knowledge of bookbinding terms and techniques is assumed, this book is meant for both novice and experienced bookmakers. The book is intended to be used as an active guide during the process of fine binding. It is arranged into sixteen sections, in the order of how they are to be undertaken (or a &#34;sequence of operations&#34;), beginning with preliminary work and ending with preparing and putting in leather doublures. Each section includes appropriately numbered instructions so that the user can find his or her place in the sequence of operations and have a reference for what step is next. There are also numbered explanatory sections that include a rationale (why you do it) and technique (how you do it). The work includes close to 300 black and white illustrations, four appendices, and a bibliography.</p><p>Jen Lindsay is a bookbinder with extensive experience in teaching, lecturing, and writing on bookbinding and the history of the book.

This edition continues the high standards set by its forebears, offering sound, down-to-earth advice on health and nutrition in an easygoing style. As before, this book aims to empower readers to take charge of their own health. Illnesses can be prevented, say the authors, through knowledge and use of proper nutrition. They call on an increasing body of scientific evidence to back their arguments that vitamin and mineral supplements can also be effective tools in disease prevention and cure. Remedies such as herbal medicine and alternative treatments including homeopathy are also explored. Tables and charts give accurate nutrition data on most common foods.</p><p>The first three editions of <i>Nutrition Almanac</i> sold more than 2.5 million copies. The 494-page fourth edition is expanded and updated, with new information to answer your questions and help you plan your personal nutritional program. "Nutrition is the relationship of foods to the health of the human body," explain the Kirschmanns (daughter and father), and they cover every aspect of how food relates to health. A detailed section on nutrients, for example, describes each vitamin and mineral, how it is absorbed and stored, dosage and toxicity, deficiency effects and symptoms, beneficial effect on ailments, and research findings. Another section offers 175 pages of common ailments and stressful conditions that may be related to nutrition, and which nutrients, exercise, herbs, and homeopathic remedies may be beneficial for each. A shorter chapter on herbs summarizes the medicinal uses of 70 herbs. The book also includes 73 pages of extensive nutritional information about common foods, showing how they help meet the RDA for each nutrient for both babies and adults. It is surprising in a book as up-to-date as this one that the authors choose to include height/desirable-weight charts, which are thought by experts to be outdated and irrelevant to health. Otherwise, this is a reference book you'll use often if you care about tracking and improving your nutrition. <i>--Joan Price</i>The Nutrition Almanac is a favorite reference in more than 2.5 million American homes for good reason. It is a complete nutritional guide that empowers you to take charge of your own health.

Dickie entered the restaurant business in 1974, gaining his first culinary experience under the tutelage of Chef Paul Prudhomme at his family's restaurant, Commander�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s Palace. After attending Louisiana State University and Loyola University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in finance in 1982, Dickie apprenticed under famed Chef Larry Forgione at An American Place restaurant in New York City. He studied the French language at the Institute de Fran�&#x192;§aise, and cooked in some of Paris' famous restaurants: La Tour d Argent, Taillevent, Chilberta, Au Quai d Orsay, La Maree and Gerard Besson. Dickie moved home to New Orleans to convert the historical, turn-of-the-century Werlein building into a grand caf�&#x192;©, much like the ones he had known in Paris. On March 11, 1991, Palace Caf�&#x192;© was born. After the first year of Palace Caf�&#x192;©s operation, Dickie�&#x201a;�&#x2019;s role expanded to include the duties of Executive Chef. To date, Dickie is the only family member to have held this position. During Dickies tenure at Palace Caf�&#x192;©, the following awards and accolades were received: 1991 Best New Restaurant Esquire magazine, 1991 Best New Restaurant USA Today, 1992 Restaurateur of the Year New Orleans Magazine, 1992 Featured Chef Great Chefs TV, 1993 Featured Chef Napa Valley Wine Auction, 1993 Featured Chef James Beard House, 1993 Featured Chef Hotel De Crillion, Paris, France. After serving as Managing Partner of Commanders Palace for several years, Dickies dream of owning and running his own restaurant company became a reality. Dickie returned to Palace Caf�&#x192;© as Managing Partner in 1997. Committed to and inspired by his vision of creating a restaurant group focused on quality, value, continuous improvement, creativity, hospitality and passion for excellence, he established Dickie Brennan &amp; Company, comprised of Palace Caf�&#x192;© and Dickie Brennans Steakhouse, which opened in 1998. Dickie is also a partner in Mr. Bs Bistro, which has been in operation for more than twenty years. Dickie Brennan &amp; Co. will add Bourbon House Seafood, a French Quarter seafood restaurant, to its portfolio in 2002. A family man above all else, Dickie admirably manages the demands of a successful career while raising two beautiful children, Sara and Richard, with his wife Leslie, with whom he published his first cookbook, Palace Cafe: The Flavor of New Orleans.</p><h2>100 Questions You&#39;d Never Ask Your Parents: Straight Answers to Teens&#39; Questions About Sex, Sexuality, and Health</h2><p><p>Teens have questions about sex. This simple manual answers their questions--honestly, simply, and reliably.</p><p>What does an orgasm feel like?</p><p>Does masturbating have any long-term negative effects?</p><p>Does alcohol kill brain cells?</p><p>Teens have questions about sex; it's a matter of who they ask and how reliable the answers are. Collected directly from teens and presented in a simple and accessible Q&amp;A format, Elisabeth Henderson and Dr. Nancy Armstrong's 100 QUESTIONS YOU'D NEVER ASK YOUR PARENTS provides information about sex, drug, body, and mood in a way that's honest, nonjudgmental, and responsible.</p></p><p><p><b>Elisabeth Henderson</b> is an educator with over a decade's experience teaching tweens and teens. She has degrees in psychology and education and is the mother of two boys.</p><p><b>Dr. Nancy Armstrong</b> is a practicing OB/GYN with thirty-five years of experience. After having two children at a young age, she put herself through college and medical school, graduating from both with honors. She enjoys volunteering and spending time with family.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>What does an orgasm feel like? <br>You&#x2019;ve asked one of the most common questions teens have, so be assured you&#x2019;re not alone in wondering. <br>An orgasm is the emotional and physical sensations that are felt at the end of sexual arousal when built-up muscle tension in the body is released. Put simply, it is the climax of the sensations that have been brought about by sexual excitement. Having an orgasm is also sometimes called &#x201c;cumming.&#x201d; <br>If you ask ten people what an orgasm feels like, you might get ten different answers because orgasms are unique to each person. For some people, an orgasm involves the whole body&#x2014;the heart races, the person may vocalize sounds or words, the muscles throughout the body may twitch, breathing can be heavy, and the person may feel flushed. For others, the feeling is more concentrated and remains in the areas of the vagina or penis. Although an orgasm will feel different to each person, it is a pleasurable feeling and often associated with euphoria and excitement. It has been described as feeling like a very strong tingling, pleasant and pulsating muscle contractions, or a warm throbbing. <br>2 <br>When I have sex the first time, will people be able to tell? <br>No. Although you may feel like everybody knows, they likely won&#x2019;t. You won&#x2019;t look any different, and there will be no outward physical signs that you&#x2019;ve had sex. You may, however, feel differently because having sex for the first time is such a big decision, both emotionally and physically. Unless you act differently, however, it is unlikely that anybody will know. <br>3 <br>Can a girl get pregnant even if she doesn&#x2019;t orgasm? <br>Absolutely. A girl can get pregnant whether or not she has an orgasm. That a girl can avoid getting pregnant by not having an orgasm is one of the biggest myths among teens. An orgasm, or lack of one, does not affect whether or not a girl can become pregnant. <br>What does affect a girl&#x2019;s ability to get pregnant is whether or not she is ovulating. Once a month a girl ovulates, which means her body releases an egg.1 If the egg is fertilized with a guy&#x2019;s sperm, it may eventually develop into a baby. The timing of the release of the egg (ovulation) is based upon the girl&#x2019;s menstrual cycle, or period. <br>Remember, lack of an orgasm has no effect on whether or not an egg is released. So, yes, a girl can get pregnant even if she doesn&#x2019;t orgasm. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2007, 2013 by Elisabeth Henderson <br></p><h2>The Spring Equinox: Celebrating the Greening of the Earth</h2><p>Describes some of the ways in which people have celebrated the coming of spring, including the Mayas, the ancient Romans, and the Cree, as well as such holidays as Passover, No Ruz, Holi, and Easter, and suggest related activities.</p><p>Grade 1-3-This is a detailed look at the history and festivals behind this special day, which occurs in the third week of March in the Northern Hemisphere. Jackson begins with ancient Mexico and the Mayans, who believed that special ceremonies were needed to rejuvenate the Earth; otherwise, it would remain cold and lifeless. She mentions other festivals and holidays that are celebrated around this time, such as Passover; Easter; No Ruz, a 13-day Iranian festival; and Holi, an Indian holiday. The book ends with a note that not all spring celebrations are rooted in ancient times, such as Earth Day. A retelling of the story of Ostara, the goddess of dawn and springtime, is included, as are some examples of seasonal activities. The attractive illustrations are as cheery and colorful as a warm and sunny spring day, adding to this informative look at the vernal equinox.<br><i>Lisa Gangemi Kropp, Middle Country Public Library, Centereach, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3-5. This attractive book completes the quartet that includes <i>The Winter Solstice</i> (1994),<i> The Autumn Equinox</i> (2000), and <i>The Summer Solstice </i> (2001). One or two spring holidays, chosen to represent a variety of cultural traditions, are spotlighted in each two-page spread. Jackson introduces children to a number of spring customs: the Cree Indian practice of offering berries to the Great Spirit; the medieval European custom of a mock battle between summer and winter; the Iranian festival of No Ruz; and the colorful Indian holiday known as Holi, as well as the more familiar Passover, Easter, and Earth Day. An adapted Anglo-Saxon myth and a few activities round out the volume. Warm spring colors set the tone in the well-composed, somewhat stylized illustrations.

Described as a man who reads and understands the Australian landscape better than most scientists, supporters of Peter Andrews claim he has done what no scientist ever thought to do - he has restored streams and wetlands to the way they were before European settlement interfered with them.

Despite her hard feelings, Grace must help rescue Sarah . . . or Sarah&#x2019;s sullied reputation will ruin her life. But was Sarah really kidnapped? It&#x2019;s up to Lady Pursuivant to find out!</p><p>All miscreants and ill-thinkers, keep out! The Lady Grace Mysteries come from the most privy and secret daybookes of <b>Lady Grace Cavendish</b>, Maid of Honour to Her Gracious Majesty, Queen Elizabeth I of that name. The author lives in Whitehall Palace, Middlesex, in God&#x2019;s Own Chosen Kingdom of England.Reviewed with Grace Cavendish's <i>Assassin</i>.<p>Gr. 4-7. This new series, ostensibly the diaries (or daybooks) of Lady Grace Cavendish (the real author is British writer Patricia Finney), takes place in the court of Queen Elizabeth I, where Grace serves as a lady-in-waiting. With plenty of twenty-first-century spunk, she solves mysteries that are turning the court upside down. In <i>Assassin</i>, one of Grace's suitors is murdered, and the 13-year-old's cool-headed calculations prove that the lord to whom she has given her hand is not the killer as everyone supposes. He is also not the man Grace believes him to be, so she gives him the boot. In <i>Betrayal</i>, another young lady-in-waiting seems to have eloped with Sir Francis Drake, but Grace uses her prognosticating skill and masquerades as a boy to prove otherwise. The books, which occasionally use Old English words (there's a glossary) and handwritten notes, are filled with details of Elizabethan life. An author's note distinguishes fact from fiction. The stories move swiftly, and the mix of history and mystery will keep kids interested. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It's not hard to see why. Like its older cousin, the <i>Baseball Encyclopedia</i>, it is a mammoth volume filled with yearly results, awards, detailed postseason and all-star accounts, and the complete career statistics of every major-league player through 1998. But while the <i>Encyclopedia</i> has basically remained a book of numbers, <i>Total Baseball</i> crams in hundreds of pages of words: there are essays on everything baseball. The lineup covers the bases from the traditional (team histories, baseball reporting, and the 400 best players) to the marvelously esoteric (baseball families, baseball movies, and women and baseball).<p> Sadly, some terrific veteran pieces--poet Donald Hall's provocative analysis of the national significance of "Casey at the Bat," an essay on baseball and the law, an account of Jackie Robinson's signing, and a comprehensive chronicle of rule and scoring changes--have been retired, so don't banish your Fifth Edition to left field. Happily, their replacements are equally all-star: a Robert Creamer essay on Casey Stengel, greater coverage of the game outside the United States, a thorough Bartlett's of baseball quotations, and Warner Fuselle's engaging history of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" and other noted arias. Finally, a caveat: the player statistics are crammed in so tightly you'll wish <i>Total Baseball</i> included a magnifying glass. Still, squinting is a small price to pay for so Ruthian a chunk of baseball heaven. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>"If I'm ever stranded on a Pacific island, I hope a copy of Total Baseball washes up on the beach." -- <i>Rob Neyer, ESPN.com Wednesday, March 21st</i><br><br>"The ultimate source for baseball information." -- <i>David Plaut, USA Today Baseball Weekly, March 21, 2001</i><br><br>"Total Baseball" remains the single indispensable book that belongs in every baseball fan's library." -- <i>Bruce Dancis, Sacramento Bee, April 8, 2001</i><br><br>"Total Baseball: The Official Encyclopedia, has published an updated seventh edition that is a tremendous addition to any sports library." -- <i>Gordon Edes, Boston Globe, March 18, 2001</i><br><br>"[Total Baseball] is baseball's Old and New Testament in one volume." -- <i>Allen Barra, Salon.com, April 18, 2001</i></p><h2>Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescence</h2><p>&#x201c;My daughter used to be so wonderful.

Wiseman has spent more than a decade listening to thousands of girls talk about the powerful role cliques play in shaping what they wear and say, how they respond to boys, and how they feel about themselves. In this candid, insightful book, she dissects each role in the clique: Queen Bees, Wannabes, Messengers, Bankers, Targets, Torn Bystanders, and more. She discusses girls&#x2019; power plays, from birthday invitations to cafeteria seating arrangements and illicit parties.

What better way could the amateur have of learning to exploit the weak play of fellow amateurs than to study how a master would handle such situations? Selected by former World Chess Champion Max Euwe and Walter Meiden, a typical amateur player, the games point out graphically how the chess master takes advantage of characteristic errors of the amateur.<br>In general, the games have been presented in order of the degree of skill of the amateur. The early games were played against beginners; later games, against "coffeehouse" players of various skill levels; the last games, against amateur "book" players. Each game, with commentary by Dr. Euwe, was chosen to illustrate a specific aspect of chess, from various openings to a number of typical chess situations. By carefully studying these games, the amateur player will learn how to recognize and avoid a variety of weak strategic and tactical moves.<br>Dr. Euwe's helpful and informative commentary on each contest consists of a discussion of significant moves in the game, an analysis of the opening used and explanations of important chess concepts as they arise. Often, he includes a detailed analysis of tactical variations that might have been played as alternatives. The result is an indispensable aid for amateurs seeking to raise the quality of their games as well as a book that can be read with profit by chess players at every level of expertise.<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>V: The Second Generation</h2><p>In 1984 Kenneth Johnson stunned the television world with his enormously popular miniseries of alien invasion, <i>V</i>.&nbsp; The <i>V</i> novelization was a bestseller.&nbsp; Now, to the delight of millions of fans and a new generation who have yet to discover the power of <i>V</i>, Johnson has written the exciting conclusion of his epic thriller.<br><br>Suffering under the lash of the alien Visitors&#x2019; control, the human underground have risked their lives for decades as they desperately try to find ways to thwart their reptilian overlords&#x2019; dire plan.&nbsp; For while the Visitors claim to be Earth&#x2019;s friends, they instead seek only to exploit our planet&#x2019;s lifeblood&#x2014;water&#x2014;and slaughter all humankind.<br><br>This pulse-pounding novel will keep readers riveted as it rockets toward a stunning conclusion both satisfying and utterly unexpected.</p><p><p>KENNETH JOHNSON has written, directed, and produced dozens of films, television shows, and miniseries, including the Emmy-winning series The Incredible Hulk, The Bionic Woman, and Alien Nation.&nbsp; In 1984, his television miniseries <i>V</i> was the highest rated show on NBC; in 2001, the DVD of the miniseries sold more than two and a half million copies.&nbsp; Johnson received the Viewers for Quality Television Award and has been nominated for both the Writer&#x2019;s Guild and Edgar Awards.&nbsp; He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Susan.</p>Johnson has been writing television science fiction (The Six Million Dollar Man; Alien Nation) for over three decades. Anticipating the 2008 television spin-off from the cult classic miniseries V, Johnson has created this insubstantial tie-in novel. Twenty years after invading, the Visitors now have a solid chokehold on Earth's scientists, intellectuals, celebrities and natural resources. While there remains an active resistance movement, they cannot stop the domination of Earth on their own. Enter the alien Zedti. Enemies of the Visitors (though sharing their general lack of concern for individual human lives), the Zedti come to the aid of the resistance efforts. Throughout, it remains ambiguous whether the Zedti are truly friends of humanity. The plethora of whiz-bang action scenes and huge cast of underdeveloped characters make this more of a primer for the new miniseries than a novel worth reading in its own right. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So he's delighted when someone comes in and buys it all. Next day, Suzie Gump arrives, the shop is empty, full of nothing, and Suzy loves it-and takes it all. Suzie has set a trend, and soon everybody is craving nothing-the stores are full of it. It's only when there's not even a towel for drying off after a bath that Suzie realizes she may have gone a bit too far. Funny and silly, this is another solid entry by Agee.</p><p>Jon Agee is the author/illustrator of a number of celebrated picture books, including <em>Milo's Hat Trick</em> (an ALA notable), <em>The Incredible Painting of Felix Clousseau </em>(an ALA notable), and <em>The Return of Freddy Legrand</em> (an SLJ Best Book). He has also created six popular books of wordplay, among them <em>Smart Feller Fart Smeller </em>and <em>Go Hang a Salami! I'm a Lasagna Hog!</em> He lives in San Francisco.<i>Starred Review.</i> Money for nothing? Certainly&#x2014;that's the premise of Agee's (<i>Terrific</i>) wry story of desire and excess. Antiques dealer Otis has sold all his wares and is sweeping his bare floor when Suzie Gump, the richest lady in town, strolls in, dressed to the nines in a gaudy pink pantsuit and walking a fashionable purse-size dog. Now, what's for sale? Suzie asks. After Otis glances around the empty store and says, Uh, nothing, Suzie writes a fat check for it. With misgivings, but believing that the customer is always right, Otis puts nothing in the trunk of her waiting car. Suzie returns the next day to crow, Nothing is wonderful!... I must have more! When Otis decides he can't in good conscience sell her more nothing, the vendors next door are more than willing, and crowds soon flock to these and numerous other stores that pop up to sell designer, discount and imported nothing. (Maybe there really was something to nothing, muses the narrator about the improbable shopping frenzy.) Fortunately for secondhand salesman Otis, in order to make room for nothing, they had to get rid of something. His shop is soon brimming with unwanted household objects and the cycle reverses. In illustrations that possess a timeless air, Agee contrasts cluttered, patterned spaces with airy rooms, outlines chunky, geometric areas with firm charcoal lines and tints broad surfaces with transparent watercolor wash. Whether enjoying this Zen-like book for the wacky conceit or the consumer critique, readers will readily recognize that the emperor has no clothes; this timely parable is certainly something worth having.

He has received the Coretta Scott King Award five times, was the U.S. nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Illustration Award, and has received four gold medals and two silver medals from the Society of Illustrators. Mr. Pinkney lives in Croton-on-Hudson, New York.Kindergarten-Grade 4-Pinkney provides a fresh perspective on an often-interpreted story without introducing unusual characters. He employs watercolor and colored pencil to create a world so filled with life that not even a flood can erase its energy. His straightforward account of Noah's story includes only minor variations from the Genesis narratives. The illustrations tell much more. Noah and his family are sturdy farmers, but they are dwarfed by the ark they build. Gathering provisions, they endure the taunts of neighbors. Waiting to board, the animals spill across the pages, not in tidy lines but in messy abundance. Yet, during the voyage, humans and animals share space peacefully. Before Noah's story starts, Pinkney offers a seascape celebrating the goodness of creation. Many of the ocean dwellers reappear in a panorama in which they swim over drowned cities while the ark floats above. Such details add to the book's visual discoveries. The final view of Earth adorned with clouds and rainbows as it floats through space reinforces the unspoken message of the wonder and fragility of the natural world. Yes, another "Noah's Ark" book needs to be squeezed onto shelves, but this one won't sit there long.<br><i>Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University, Mankato</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Use of the Arts of Language</h2><p><p>Grammar-school students in Shakespeare&#x2019;s time were taught to recognize the two hundred figures of speech that Renaissance scholars had derived from Latin and Greek sources (from amphibologia through onomatopoeia to zeugma). This knowledge was one element in their thorough grounding in the liberal arts of logic, grammar, and rhetoric, known as the trivium. In Shakespeare&#x2019;s Use of the Arts of Language Sister Miriam Joseph writes: &#x201c;The extraordinary power, vitality, and richness of Shakespeare&#x2019;s language are due in part to his genius, in part to the fact that the unsettled linguistic forms of his age promoted to an unusual degree the spirit of creativeness, and in part to the theory of composition then prevailing . . . The purpose of this study is to present to the modern reader the general theory of composition current in Shakespeare&#x2019;s England.&#x201d; The author then lays out those figures of speech in simple, understandable patterns and explains each one with examples from Shakespeare. Her analysis of his plays and poems illustrates that the Bard knew more about rhetoric than perhaps anyone else!

Over forty years later, Sherrilyn Ifill&#x2019;s On the Courthouse Lawn examines the numerous ways that this racial trauma still resounds across the United States. While the lynchings and their immediate aftermath were devastating, the little-known contemporary consequences, such as the marginalization of political and economic development for black Americans, are equally pernicious.<br><br>On the Courthouse Lawn investigates how the lynchings implicated average white citizens, some of whom actively participated in the violence, while many others witnessed the lynchings but did nothing to stop them. Ifill observes that this history of complicity has become embedded in the social and cultural fabric of local communities, who either supported, condoned, or ignored the violence. She traces the lingering effects of two lynchings in Maryland to illustrate how ubiquitous this history is and issues a clarion call for American communities with histories of racial violence to be proactive in facing this legacy today.<br><br>Inspired by South Africa&#x2019;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well as by techniques of restorative justice, Ifill provides concrete ideas to help communities heal, including placing gravestones on the unmarked burial sites of lynching victims, issuing public apologies, establishing mandatory school programs on the local history of lynching, financially compensating those whose family homes or businesses were destroyed in the aftermath of lynching, and creating commemorative public spaces. Because the contemporary effects of racial violence are experienced most intensely in local communities, Ifill argues that reconciliation and reparation efforts must also be locally based in order to bring both black and white Americans together in an efficacious dialogue.<br><br>A landmark book, On the Courthouse Lawn is a much-needed and urgent road map for communities finally confronting lynching&#x2019;s long shadow by embracing pragmatic reconciliation and reparation efforts.<br><br>&#x201c;Professor Ifill has written a sobering and eye-opening book on one of America&#x2019;s darkest secrets. On the Courthouse Lawn offers a compelling examination of lynchings and describes the failure of people and institutions to adequately address one of America&#x2019;s tragedies. Racial amnesia would suggest we forget this history. Professor Ifill assures us that we cannot&#x2014;and should not&#x2014;forget it. This is a must read for anyone willing to examine our history carefully and learn from it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., Jesse Climenko Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, and executive director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice<br><br>&#x201c;On the Courthouse Lawn is an elegantly written and persuasively argued case for local communities to confront their history of lynching and racial violence as a means of healing race relations. Explaining how Truth and Reconciliation worked in South Africa, Ifill explores the possibilities and offers concrete advice on how it could be widely employed in the United States. It is certainly worth trying.&#x201d; &#x2014;Mary Frances Berry, Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought and professor of History, University of Pennsylvania <br><br>&#x201c;In calm, objective but no less moving detail, Sherrilyn Ifill&#x2019;s book provides the stories that illuminate the photographs and postcards of lynchings, the punishment meted out to some 5,000 black people deemed guilty without trial for matters large and small during the first half of the twentieth century. Too late for justice for the victims of lynch law, Professor Ifill urges that an American version of South Africa&#x2019;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission could bring long-denied acknowledgment to whites and a measure of consolation to blacks.&#x201d; &#x2014;Derrick Bell, author of Faces at the Bottom of the Well and Ethical Ambition</p><p>Sherrilyn A. Ifill is a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law. She is also a civil rights lawyer and a regular speaker on race, public policy, and law. She lives in Baltimore.Taking the eastern shore of Maryland as her starting point, Ifill uses two 1930s lynchings among quaint, close-knit coastal communities to examine the sprawling topic of racial violence in America. As a border state between North and South, Maryland has been home to some of America's most racially progressive elements (Thurgood Marshall, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass and the NAACP) as well as the most conservative (the Baltimore Harbor slave market, Spiro Agnew and Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney). Set against this backdrop, Ifill's careful work unpacks the events surrounding these two brutal crimes, pushing past the persistent denial of the communities involved to uncover the facts. Ifill presents the players-judges, policemen, lawyers, business leaders and journalists-and reconstructs the complex relations that tied them together and eventually led key members to engender and sanction the execution of George Armwood and Matthew Williams.

Perhaps the best known of all Buddhist sutras, it is recited in Buddhist centers and monasteries around the world. Emphasizing a living wisdom directly experienced, the schools of Chan have revered the <i>Heart Sutra</i> for its concise expression of the core revelations of the Buddha.<br><br><i>There Is No Suffering</i> is Chan Master Sheng-yen's commentary on the <i>Heart Sutra</i>. He speaks on the sutra from the Chan point of view, and presents it as a series of contemplation methods, encouraging readers to experience it directly through meditation and daily life. In this way, reading the<i> Heart Sutra</i> becomes more than just an intellectual exercise; it becomes a method of practice by which one can awaken to the fundamental wisdom inherent within each of us. Whether one wants a better understanding of Buddhist concepts or a deepened meditation practice, this commentary on the <i>Heart Sutra</i> can help.</p><p>Chan Master Sheng-yen is a Buddhist monk who received transmission in two major Chan lineages. He holds a doctorate in Buddhist literature from Rissho University in Japan. He is the author of over one hundred texts on Buddhism, and his books have been translated into eight languages. He has been lecturing and directing retreats for more than twenty-five years in Asia, North America, and Europe.Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Speaking Land: Myth and Story in Aboriginal Australia</h2><p>The speaking land is an anthology of almost 200 myth from a number of different aboriginal cultures. The stories are a major contribution to the development and recognition of an aboriginal traditional literature. The stories are grouped around themes such as snakes and rainbows, breaking the rules, stories of origins, eroticism and the clash of aboriginal and western cultures. None of the stories are of a secret-sacred nature.</p><p>MYTHOLOGY / ABORIGINAL CULTURE <br> <br>The 195 stories collected in this first anthology of Aboriginal myth were told to anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt, who spent nearly fifty years working among the Aboriginal peoples of Australia. <br> <br>The Berndts developed a system of field research that allowed them entrance into a culture that has been alive for more than 100,000 years: Ronald Berndt met with male storytellers, while Catherine met with the women. The myths they collected come from the oldest collective memory of humankind, describing characters and events of the "Dreamtime"--a time that existed before the material world was formed. <br> <br> <em>The Speaking Land</em> touches on all aspects of life: creation, natural forces, social rules, and the exotic. Stark, tinged with fantasy, sometimes bizarre, the myths chronicle the actions of the Ancestors, portraying not only beauty and wonder but also scenes of conflict: treachery and theft, jealousy and lust, greed and antagonism, injury and death. The lessons of life implicit in these stories are still reflected in the simplicity and deep spirituality of this culture. <br> <br>In all of the myths collected here the land is as important as the living characters who travel it. In the Dreamtime creation, mythic, shape-changing characters moved across the countryside, leaving part of their eternal spiritual qualities in the land. Eventually, these characters and forces retreated into the living environment, where they remain today, spiritually anchored. The land still speaks to us, and <em>The Speaking Land</em> will help us understand its language. <br></p><h2>From Berlin to Jerusalem: Memories of My Youth</h2><p>The eminent Jewish scholar recalls the chief events and people of his Berlin childhood, the circumstances leading to his migration to Palestine, and his initial responses to his new homeland</p><p>Gershom Scholem: Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) was born in Berlin, educated at the universities of Jena and Bern, and emigrated to Palestine in 1923, where he devoted himself to the study of the Jewish mystical tradition and the Kabbalah. One of the greatest scholars of the twentieth century, admired both for his philological prowess and his philosophical insight, Scholem was the author of many books, including <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism</i>, <i>On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism</i>, <i>Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah</i>, and <i>On Jews and Judaism in Crisis</i>, a collection of autobiographical writings and essays on Zionism.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915-1918</h2><p>The Western Front dominates our memories of the First World War. Yet, a million and half men died in North East Italy in a war that need never have happened, when Italy declared war on the Habsburg Empire in May 1915. Led by General Luigi Cadorna, the most ruthless of all the Great War commanders, waves of Italian conscripts were sent charging up the limestone hills north of Trieste to be massacred by troops fighting to save their homelands. This is a great, tragic military history of a war that gave birth to fascism. Mussolini fought in these trenches, but so did many of the greatest modernist writers in Italian and German - Ungaretti, Gadda, Musil, Hemingway. It is through these accounts that Mark Thompson, with great skill and empathy, brings to life this forgotten conflict.</p><p>Mark Thompson lives in Oxford. He is the author of A Paper House, a much-praised account of the fall of Yugoslavia. He worked for the UN in the Balkans for much of the 1990s.<b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b><br> &#x201c;[A] study as pioneering as it is brilliant.... Drawing on an impressive array of British, Italian, and Austrian sources, including fascinating interviews with survivors, Thompson re-creates the Italo-Austrian conflict in all its facets.... The White War is the work of a bright young historian proving his mettle.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><br> &#x201c;Thompson?s book is a comprehensive work following the causes, culture and combat of Italy?s war against Austria-Hungary and Germany.... It?s worthwhile reading and remembering, particularly when trying to comprehend what price victory.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Robert Fox, <i>Evening Standard</i></b><br> &#x201c;Brilliant.... It is the first general history of the serial incompetence and brutality of the war in north-eastern Italy between 1915 and 1918, which makes it exceptional enough. In its elegant sweep of cultural and political as well as martial themes, it stands alone: it is one of the outstanding history books of the year.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Christopher Duggan, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br> &#x201c;Mark Thompson?s wonderfully rich and poignant study, beautifully written and based on a detailed first-hand knowledge of the terrain in question as well as an impressive array of published Italian sources shows graphically why the events of 1915-18 had such a searing effect on the country?s national psyche.&#x201d;<br><br><br><br><b>Max Hastings, <i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br> &#x201c;Mark Thompson, a young British writer, can claim a notable achievement with his narrative history of Italy?s World War I experience. With authority, sympathy, and unusual literary skill, he illuminates an aspect of the conflict about which some of us feel embarrassed to have known so little. The battlefield saga is sufficiently fascinating, but eclipsed by the portrait of Italy?s social and cultural experience within which the author sets it.... Thompson?s book gives a fascinating, indeed brilliant, portrait of a society immolated by its own delusions.&#x201d;&lt;<br><br><b><i>The Economist</i> (Best Books of the Year)</b><br> &#x201c;A startling indictment of the Italian state?s conduct during the first world war, which shows how Italy?s nationalist dream of expansion would turn into the Fascist nightmare.&#x201d;<br><br><b>John McCourt, <i>Irish Times</i></b><br> &#x201c;Brilliant.... In presenting this conflict with such uncompromising focus and detail, Thompson has successfully accomplished a necessarily uncomfortable act of remembrance.... It should be hailed as the best account yet of what Hemingway described as `the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery? of the Great War and of the experiences of the vast majority of Italian soldiers who, in Giovanni Comisso?s words, had little or no knowledge of `what they had done, or why.?&#x201d;<br><br></p><h2>Reading the OED: One Man, One Year, 21,730 Pages</h2><p>An obsessive word lover provides an entertaining account of the year he spent reading the Oxford English Dictionary cover to cover, offering a colorful selection of obscure, hilarious, and offbeat vocabulary gems he discovered along the way.</p><p><b>Ammon Shea</b> is the author of two previous books on obscure words, <i>Depraved English</i> and <i>Insulting English</i> (written with Peter Novobatzky).

(He does most of his OED reading at the Hunter College Library and finds himself turning into one of those &#x201c;Library People&#x201d; as the year goes by.)&nbsp;He shares a number of words that, though they have fallen out of the common vocabulary,&nbsp;could be put to excellent use today: empleomania: &#x201c;a manic compulsion to hold public office&#x201d;; zabernism: &#x201c;a misuse of military authority.&#x201d;&nbsp;The book will happify (&#x201c;make happy&#x201d;) word and dictionary lovers, who will be able to&nbsp;read it in an hour or two, much less time than it takes to read the OED. --Mary Ellen Quinn</p><h2>Count the Monkeys</h2><p>Kids will giggle as they count all the animals that have frightened the monkeys off the pages. Full of fun reader interactions and keeps readers guessing until the very last page! Matching Mac Barnett&#39;s brilliant wit are Kevin Cornell&#39;s luminous illustrations, which will have young readers begging to count the monkeys all over again.</p><p>Carrying out the titular imperative proves tough, given that, on every spread, monkeys are nowhere to be seen. Luckily, the mounting number of predators that have scared them off can be enumerated, even if their appearances don't always jive with the classic food chain. There's one very vain king cobra on the opening spread, but soon the action devolves to include "6 sweet old beekeepers" and "10 polka-dotted rhinoceroses with bagpipes and bad breath." Cornell (who previously teamed up with Barnett for Mustache!) is an artist in the modern-day Disney animation tradition, effortlessly juggling funny chaos, irreverent characterizations, and visual winks and nudges. Barnett's narrator may be increasingly frustrated ("We're never going to count the monkeys!") but he also has expert comic timing, includes multiple opportunities for audience participation, and riffs on collaborative learning: "Look! 2 mongooses have chased away that cobra! Or is that 2 mongeese? I am pretty sure it is 2 monogooses. Let's vote." This spot-on spoof of counting books is the perfect reward for anyone who's put in a hard day's work with numbers, big or small. Ages 3 6. PW"<br><br>How does one count the monkeys if there are no monkeys left to count? A philosophical question of the ages (and storytime). The title page drolly advises readers from the start: "It's fun. It's easy. All you have to do is turn the page ." But there are no monkeys! Instead, there is a giant king cobra who has slithered across the entire book and scared all of the monkeys away. The audience is now directed to "[t]urn the page very slowly, very carefully so he doesn't notice us." Are the monkeys on the next page? Nope. But there are two mongooses who have chased away the cobra. Or is it mongeese? Barnett polls the readers, asking their opinion. And so it goes. Three dapper crocodiles frighten the mongooses, four picnic-loving grizzly bears frighten the crocodiles-but will there ever be any monkeys? This kinetic, raucous read-aloud invites kids to hum tunes, roar loudly, close their eyes and politely say "thank you" six times to the sweet old-lady beekeepers who chase away the bees. But alas, the book runs out of pages before those petrified primates ever make an appearance. (Thank goodness for endpapers.) More fun than a barrel of well, you know. (Picture book. 3-6) Kirkus"<br><br>Although counting books may tire out jaded grown-ups, a good one will always get youngsters excitedly running through their numbers. Barnett begins with a call: "Hey, kids! Time to count the monkeys!" But his simians won't show, having been scared off. So who scared them off? Maybe those two mongooses? Or those three crocodiles? Barnett instructs readers to ward off each group of beasts with various techniques. For example, on a page featuring four grizzly bears, the instructions say, "Put your arms above your head! Make a loud roar! Bang together some pots and pans, if you have them." (This isn't a book to read during quiet time.) Besides the chance to make noise, kids will adore Cornell's broadly exaggerated animals, from the toothy monkey grins to the round bottoms of bearded lumberjacks. The whole package has a Saturday-morning-cartoon cheerfulness. And when the monkeys still haven't appeared at the purported end, never fear. The last spread will keep counters content for a good long while. Adult patience advised. - Karen Cruze Booklist"<br><br>Barnett is back with a zany interactive counting book that's sure to tickle youngsters' funny bones. The text starts on the title page with the words: "Hey kids! Time to count the monkeys all you have to do is turn the page ." But on the first page, one king cobra has scared them off. Next, two mongooses frighten off the cobra, and so on, with ever-increasing numbers of wacky animals and people until "10 polka-dotted rhinoceroses with bagpipes and bad breath" are called upon to get rid of 9 lumberjacks and the book runs out of pages, leaving 0 monkeys. Don't despair, because the final page turn reveals a huge number of monkeys filling up the endpapers. Cornell's full-bleed cartoon artwork featuring mongooses wearing numbered racing tops, crocodiles with top hats and canes, and an assortment of lumberjacks in plaid tops sporting a variety of mustaches and beards is a perfect fit for Barnett's chatty, tongue-in-cheek tone. Cornell packs the pages with oversize characters and plenty of color, all on a green backdrop reminiscent of the jungle from the initial endpaper. The story unfolds in an almost cinematic style that will have young listeners impatiently turning the pages. Barnett's Chloe and the Lion (Hyperion, 2012) broke into metafiction, making it more accessible to older readers. This title is more straightforward and will appeal to fans of What to Do If an Elephant Stands on Your Foot (Dial, 2012) and other interactive books. Sure to be a hit, even if those elusive monkeys are rather difficult to count when they finally make an appearance.

In THE MARCH OF FOLLY, Tuchman examines 4 conflicts: The Trojan Horse, The Protestant Secession, The American Revolution, and The American War in Vietnam. In each example an alternative course of action was available, the actions were endorsed by a group, not just an individual leader, and the actions were perceived as counter productive in their own time. Many individuals are guilty of folly (Tuchman also calls this woodenheadedness), but when governments persist in folly, their actions can adversely affect thousands, even millions of lives. Folly is a child of power. "The power to command frequently causes failure to think."(p.32). THE MARCH OF FOLLY may not be as well known as A DISTANT MIRROR and THE GUNS OF AUGUST, but it is my favorite of her works. I heartily recommend it to any Tuchman fans who have not yet discovered it.<br><br>Randy Hickernell<br>Ballantine sales reper of the Pulitzer Prize, author Barbara Tuchman now tackles the pervasive presence of folly in governments through the ages. Defining folly as the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interersts, despite the availability of feasible alternatives, Tuchman details four decisive turning points in history that illustrate the very heights of folly in government: the Trojan War, the breakup of the Holy See provoked by the Renaissance Popes, the loss of the American colonies by Britain&#39;s George III, and the United States&#39; persistent folly in Vietnam. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings the people, places, and events of history magnificently alive for today&#39;s reader.</p><h2>Gruppe on Color: Using Expressive Color to Paint Nature</h2><p>Gruppe&#39; shows you how to paint spring ,summer, fall and winter in a loss story telling way use that big brush hit it and forget it .</p><p></p><h2>An Unlikely Romance (Harlequin Romance, No 3222)</h2><p>&#34;You have no objection to being married, do you?&#34; Agreeing to share her life with Professor van der Brink-Shaaksma had seemed a good idea to Beatrice at the time. But while fine in theory, the &#34;no strings attached&#34; deal soon proved to be disastrous. How could it work when every time she saw him, her heart skipped a beat? And what could she now do to make him notice her - not just as his wife but as his partner?</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.Trixie Doveton, trundling old Mrs Crowe from the bathroom back to her ward, allowed a small, almost soundless sigh to escape her lips. The ward doors had been thrust open and Professor van der Brink-Schaaksma was coming unhurriedly towards her. He had a sheaf of papers under one arm and a book, one finger marking his place, in his other hand. He wasn't due for another twenty minutes and Sister Snell was already hurrying after him, intent on heading him off with a cup of coffee in her office while her nurses raced around getting the patients into the correct state of readiness. He was always doing it, reflected Trixie, rolling Mrs Crowe's ample person into her bed; arriving early, not arriving at all, or arriving half an hour late, tendering the politest of apologies when he discovered his mistake, his brilliant mind engrossed in some ticklish problem concerning endocrinology, a science of which he was a leading exponent. Trixie took another look at him while she tucked Mrs Crowe into her blankets; he was such a nice man&#x2014;the nicest she had ever met, not that she had actually met him, only seen him from time to time on the ward or in one of the corridors, either with his nose buried in some book or other or surrounded by students. She was quite sure that he wasn't even aware that she existed. He was towering over Sister Snell now, smiling gently down at her rather cross face, a tall, very large man, his pale hair grey at the temples, his eyes heavy-lidded and, she suspected, quite unaware of his good looks. He glanced up and she glanced away quickly, and when she peeped again it was to see his massive back disappearing through the doors.<p>'He's a nice chap, ain't he?' observed Mrs Crowe. 'No side to him neither.'</p><p>She beamed at Trixie's face; she was a friendly girl who would always find time to say a few words, offer sympathy when needed and even, when her seniors weren't looking, put in a few curlers for such of her patients who needed to be smartened up for visitors. She would have enlarged upon this but Staff Nurse Bennett, racing up and down like a demented sergeant major, had come to a halt by the bed.</p><p>'Nurse Doveton, for heaven's sake get a move on. Professor van der Brink-Schaaksma's here, far too soon of course, and the place is like a pigsty and you standing there gossiping. It's time you learned to be quicker; you'll never make a good nurse at this rate. All this mooning about...'</p><p>She hurried away, saying over her shoulder, 'Find Nurse Saunders, she's in one of the treatment-rooms, and tell her to make sure all the path lab reports are on the trolley.'</p><p>Trixie patted Mrs Crowe's plump shoulder and trotted off obediently. She was a small girl, nicely plump with a face which, while not plain, was hardly pretty; her nose was too short and her mouth too large, but it curved up at the corners and her smile was charming. Only her eyes were beautiful, large and hazel with pale brown lashes to match the neat head of hair under her cap. She was twenty-three years old, an orphan and prepared to make the best of it. She had the kindest of hearts, a romantic nature and a good deal of common sense, and she liked her job. In another year she would have completed her training, despite Staff Nurse Bennett's gloomy prediction. She was aware that she would never be another Florence Nightingale, but at least she would be earning her living.</p><p>Nurse Saunders was in a bad mood; she had had words with her boyfriend on the previous evening and had no chance of seeing him for several days to come. She listened to Trixie's message impatiently, thumped down the tray of instruments she was holding and said, 'Oh, all right. Just put these away for me and look sharp about it. Why can't the man come when he's supposed to?'</p><p>She didn't give Trixie a chance to answer, but went into the ward, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Trixie arranged the instruments tidily in the cupboard, tidied up a tiny bit and opened the door; the professor wouldn't have finished his coffee yet. She would have time to slip into the sluice-room and find something to do there. The coffee must have been tepid or the professor's mouth made of cast iron, for he was there, in the ward, only a few yards away, deep in talk with Dr Johnson, while Sister hovered at his other side against a reverent background of medical students, and behind them the furious face of Staff Nurse Bennett. Trixie, intent on a prudent retreat into the treatment-room, took a step backwards, tripped over her own feet and tumbled untidily to the floor. She had barely touched it when the professor paused in the discussion, stooped forward, plucked her back on to the offending feet, dusted her down, patted her on her shoulder without apparently having looked at her and resumed his conversation. It had all happened so quickly that beyond a startled look from Sister and grins from the students the unfortunate incident might never have been. Trixie, edging her way to a discreet distance, doubted if the professor had noticed her; he was notoriously absent-minded, and he would have done the same thing for a child, an old lady or an overturned chair.</p><p>In the fastness of the sluice-room she polished and scrubbed everything in sight; it wasn't her job but she felt that she should make amends for annoying Staff Nurse Bennett, and&#x2014;once that young lady had had the chance to tell her&#x2014;Sister.</p><p>Sure enough, later that morning she was told to go to Sister's office where she was reprimanded by that lady. 'Professor van der Brink-Schaaksma is not to be bothered in such a manner, Nurse Doveton. He has far more important things to do than picking up girls off the floor. How could you be so clumsy?'</p><p>'I was surprised,' observed Trixie reasonably, 'and he need not have picked me up&#x2014;I mean I didn't ask for help or anything like that.' She smiled kindly at her senior, who was quite scarlet with ill temper. 'I'm so sorry if it upset you, Sister. It was most tiresome of me but I don't think the professor noticed anything.'</p><p>Sister Snell said crossly, 'It is to be hoped not. Go and do Mrs Watts's ulcer and then take her down to physiotherapy. When are you off duty?'</p><p>'Five o'clock, Sister, and then I have a day off.'</p><p>The day with its manifold tasks wore on. Because Mrs Watts had held things up by feeling sick, Trixie was late for her midday dinner. The canteen was almost empty by the time she got there, although several of her friends were still sitting over their cups of tea. She fetched boiled cod&#x2014;it was Friday&#x2014;and mashed potatoes and parsnips, and joined them.</p><p>'You're late,' observed Mary Fitzjohn accusingly. She was a girl who took pride in plain speaking, correcting people and telling them if they had a ladder in their tights or their caps were on crooked. She had a good opinion of herself and was tolerated in an amused way.</p><p>Trixie lavished tomato sauce on the fish. 'Mrs Watts felt sick.' She began to gobble her dinner. 'I must go over to my room and pack a bag. I've got a day off.'</p><p>'Going home?' a fat girl with a pretty face asked.</p><p>'Yes. It's Margaret's birthday.'</p><p>'A party?'</p><p>'Well, a cocktail party.'</p><p>'What will you wear?' chorused several voices.</p><p>'There's the blue crepe or that brown velvet. The brown, I think&#x2014;after all, it is october.'</p><p>'Surely you should have something new and smart for a cocktail party?' asked Mary, looking down her nose.</p><p>'Me? I shan't know anyone there&#x2014;Margaret has masses of friends, you know, and I don't know any of them. I mean I don't intend to dazzle them&#x2014;it's her party.'</p><p>'I should have thought&#x2014;' began Mary, and was silenced by a general chorus of 'shut up'. Trixie dealt with treacle tart, swallowed her tea and darted off; there was still ten minutes before she needed to be back on duty and in her room she packed an overnight bag with neat efficiency, straightened her cap and made her way from the nurses' home to the ward once more. She wasn't really looking forward to the party; she had lived with Aunt Alice and Uncle William ever since her parents had died in an accident when she was ten years old, and although they had educated her, fed her and clothed her and in their way been kind to her, she had never been quite happy, for somehow the knowledge that they were doing their duty and at the same time resenting her being there had been borne in upon her before very long. As she had grown she had realised that their interest was centred on their daughter Margaret, pretty and popular and spoilt, and as soon as she had left school Trixie had suggested that she should train for a nurse, but to her surprise this was frowned upon. Margaret had no intention of doing anything and Aunt Alice had realised that if Trixie were allowed to leave home there might be raised eyebrows over the fact that, while her own daughter stayed at home enjoying herself, their ward had to earn her own living. So Trixie had spent several years making herself useful around the large house at Highgate, meeting very few people, for Aunt Alice had let it be known that she was a shy girl and disliked social occasions, and she might have been there still if one of Margaret's more eligible men friends hadn't started to show an interest in Trixie, and, since she hadn't liked him very much and gave him no encouragement, he'd begun to feel himself quite interested and serious about her. It was time, decided Aunt Alice, to do something about the matter. Trixie had been told that, now that she was older and with no prospect of marriage in sight, if she still wished to do so she might apply for training at one of the London teaching hospitals. Something she'd done very quickly before anyone could change their minds. She wasn't quite twenty-one when she began her training, which from Aunt Alice's point of view was...</p></p><h2>New Mexico Atlas &amp; Gazetteer</h2><p>The first choice of outdoors enthusiasts.

Klaus Uhltzscht, born in 1968 in East Germany, grows up across the street from the Ministry of State Security, and he is inspired early on to do his share to win the Cold War. Naturally he joins the Secret Police, but his glorious career as an international agent never materializes. Instead, he spends countless hours keeping his fellow citizens under close surveillance -- never quite sure what he is looking for. Frustrated on all counts, Klaus's life is changed only when a strange accident in the fall of 1989 dramatically alters the size of his penis.</p></p><p>The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and according to Klaus Uhltzscht, hero of German author Thomas Brussig's novel, <i>Heroes Like Us</i>, he was responsible. Klaus feels responsible for a lot of things, not the least of which is his parents' happiness. It is to please his father--an agent with the notorious East German secret police, the Stasi--that Klaus himself joins up. Once there, he has serious doubts about whether <i>his</i> Stasi is the genuine article or just a decoy to distract attention from the Stasi for which his father works. When the Wall finally falls, Klaus worries that his activities will be distorted in the Western press, so he decides to unburden himself to Oscar Kitzelstein, a <i>New York Times</i> correspondent. The darkly ribald, satirical tale Klaus tells in <i>Heroes Like Us</i> marks the strong debut of an important new voice in the postcommunist literary world.John Brownjohn is an award-winning translator.</p><h2>Digesting the child within: And other cartoons to live by</h2><p>No one escapes the sharp pen of the knife-eyed maniac who somehow remains saner and wiser than the rest of us.

She is the author of several decorating books, including the original edition of <i>Country Living Cottage Style</i>, as well as <i>Country Living Farmhouses</i>, and <i>House Beautiful Decorating with Books</i>, all published by Hearst Books. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.Country Living magazine is known for its range of decorating and design books, and this latest volume by Hueston (Country Living's Guide to the Best Flea Markets) focuses on the popular cottage style. Conjuring up images of English chintz, patchwork quilts, slipcovers and easy comfortable living, the style can be applied anywhere, from rooms in New York apartments or California bungalows to coastal retreats and holiday homes. Lavishly illustrated with carefully captioned full-color photographs throughout, the volume is divided into six sections covering the four major living areas (living rooms, kitchens and dining areas, bedrooms, and bathrooms) before concluding with a chapter of quick fixes (an assortment of easy decorating ideas ranging from vintage tablecloths to canning jars as flower vases). Each main area is described, with examples of the cottage feel given and suggestions made for conveying its flavor to fit various scenarios. Scattered throughout are individual pages covering "Quintessential Cottage" ranging from window seats to Dutch doors and cast-iron bed frames that harken to a bygone age. With relatively little text, this slim book relies on the photos and their captions to explain each design element, which it accomplishes with modest success. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Vanishing Act</h2><p>One of the world&#39;s preeminent nature photographers shows the beauty and evolutionary brilliance of animals and insects with a tenacious will to stay alive in an eat-or-be-eaten world.</p><p>Art Wolfe is one of the world's most popular nature photographers and a passionate wildlife advocate.

Thompson, Gaiman's collaborator, has created a world of the Endless as children. In this story, Delirium's small dog is in charge of keeping her safe, because she is easily distracted. When he goes off into the woods to see a man about a tree, she goes off in search of him. When he returns he cannot find her so he visits each of her siblings, including Destiny and Death (two major characters in <i>Sandman</i>), to try to find her. Each one gives him a charm (a symbol of their adult character), but it is not clear how they will help him. It is difficult to determine the intended audience, although the book itself indicates it is meant for mature audiences. The writing is uneven, and the humor is very adult, but the plot is simple and too predictable for older readers. Not a true graphic novel, but an illustrated story, the full-page manga-style art seems aimed at younger children. <i>Sandman</i> fans are the most likely audience, and they are sure to find these illustrations disappointing and substandard.<i>&#x2013;Ronnie Gordon, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A new and thriving culture has sprung up as thousands gather each weekend to pinch, poke, smell, and probe the produce--&#x2014;and at times each other. Who knew that buying peaches and eggplants could be such fun? <p>Mike Madison, who raises organic flowers, melons, olives, and apricots, has been setting up at these markets for over twenty years. With keen observations and sly wit, Madison presents a series of essays and vignettes that introduce us to the characters who make our food, the economy that produces it, and the spirit that has placed farmers' markets among the fastest growing movements in the country.</p></p><p>Mike Madison lives with his wife Diane in Winters, California, where they have created the Yolo Bulb, a small truck farm in the Sacramento Valley. His previous book, <i>Walking the Flatlands</i>, is available from Heyday. He is also the author of <i>No Time to Nap</i>.''Madison writes beautifully. He is a master of atmosphere, and creates imagery that the reader will want to linger over.''--<i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i><p>''Mike Madison is a rare find: a person who possesses both the pragmatism required of a farmer and the keen eye for flawed human nature required of a humorist. [<i>Blithe Tomato</i>] is proof that it's an irresistible combination.''--<i>Saveur</i></p><p> ''[Madison's] short, sharp pieces draw readers into psychological landscape of a small-scale farmer, but they also reflect his observations of his customers: the people who swoon at the scent of lilacs, a colorful character he calls the Old Basque, and a man with a faraway look and a jittery woman (who finally appear grounded after Mr. Madison notices them hand in hand).''--<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>''With a Chekhovian eye for detail, Mike Madison has assembled a fascinating group portrait of the fellow growers--endangered individualists all, eccentrics, recluses, dreamers, anarchists--who work the land of his extended neighborhood.

This is an ecstatic journey through the unheard history of Babalon. This is an explicit and challenging vision of a very modern goddess coming into power. From Revelations, back through the Ishtar Gate and forward into a living modern magickal current. This is more than a history, it is a passionate account of living magick and the transcendent power of Love. The epic sweep of the text takes us from Babylon to Jerusalem to Rome, and onward to Apocalypse. It confronts us with the language and symbols of our own culture and the denied demonic feminine. It looks at the Angelic work of Renaissance mage John Dee and places it in a European eschatology. It delivers a devastating exegesis on the excesses of Aleister Crowley, and unlocks the secrets of Waratah Blossoms. It explains the immolation of the Californian antichrist-superstar Jack Parsons and his relationship with scientology founder L.Ron Hubbard. There is also a full supporting cast of Solomon, Simon Magus, St John the Divine, Earl Bothwell, the Templars, Mary, the Magdalene and countless others. This is the missing history of the Love Goddess in the West. Thirteen essays conclude the book on subjects including: roses, mirror magick, aphrodisiac drugs, the information age, love vs lust, and the meaning of apocalypse.

He lived and ministered as both a pastor and author in the towns and villages of South Africa. Some of Murray&#x2019;s earliest works were written to provide nurture and guidance to Christians, whether young or old in the faith; they were actually an extension of his pastoral work. Once books such as <i>Abide in Christ, Divine Healing, </i>and<i> With Christ in the School of Prayer</i> were written, Murray became widely known, and new books from his pen were awaited with great eagerness throughout the world.<br> He wrote to give daily practical help to many of the people in his congregation who lived out in the farming communities and could come into town for church services only on rare occasions. As he wrote these books of instruction, Murray adopted the practice of placing many of his more devotional books into thirty-one separate readings to correspond with the days of the month.<br> At the age of seventy-eight, Murray resigned from the pastorate and devoted most of his time to his manuscripts. He continued to write profusely, moving from one book to the next with an intensity of purpose and a zeal that few men of God have ever equaled. He often said of himself, rather humorously, that he was like a hen about to hatch an egg; he was restless and unhappy until he got the burden of the message off his mind.<br> During these later years, after hearing of pocket-sized paperbacks, Andrew Murray immediately began to write books to be published in that fashion. He thought it was a splendid way to have the teachings of the Christian life at your fingertips, where they could be carried around and read at any time of the day.<br> One source has said of Andrew Murray that his prolific style possesses the strength and eloquence that are born of deep earnestness and a sense of the solemnity of the issues of the Christian life. Nearly every page reveals an intensity of purpose and appeal that stirs men to the depths of their souls. Murray moves the emotions, searches the conscience, and reveals the sins and shortcomings of many of us with a love and hope born out of an intimate knowledge of the mercy and faithfulness of God.<br> For Andrew Murray, prayer was considered our personal home base from which we live our Christian lives and extend ourselves to others. During his later years, the vital necessity of unceasing prayer in the spiritual life came to the forefront of his teachings. It was then that he revealed the secret treasures of his heart concerning a life of persistent and believing prayer.<br> Countless people the world over have hailed Andrew Murray as their spiritual father and given credit for much of their Christian growth to the influence of his priceless devotional books.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Button Button, Identification and Price Guide</h2><p>This well-organized guide is recommended by the Button Society as a book that every button collector and dealer should own.

A startling collection of &#34;hip&#34; stories by an impressive young writer, torn from the shadows of the twilight world.This hardcover reprint of the 1955 original paperback showcases the young, raw, sometimes clumsy Ellison, a writer who hasn&#x2019;t quite developed the storytelling or prose style he will soon become known for. Unusual for Ellison, these stories aren&#x2019;t science fiction (or, more broadly, speculative fiction). Set during the 1950s, the stories focus on issues that were on the author&#x2019;s mind at the time: discrimination, oppression, racial hatred, and other injustices. Where Ellison would later use the sf genre as a means of exploring these issues from other (sometimes allegorical) angles, here he tackles them head-on, with mixed results: some of the stories are graceful and revelatory, while others come off a bit ham-fisted, as though the author sought to punch the issue right in the nose rather than&#x2014;as he would later in his career&#x2014;dance around it a bit first. Definitely for the author&#x2019;s legion of fans (who will forgive a little clunkiness from the guy, who was, after all, just starting out). --David Pitt</p><h2>Grading Coins by Photographs</h2><p>In Grading Coins by Photographs, Q.

Read him at your peril." (Anthony Bourdain)</strong><br><br> An aging New Yorker, a writer named Nick, feels life ebbing out of him. The world has gone to hell and Nick is so sick of it all that he can't even have a glass of champagne. Then one night he meets a tantalizing young woman who agrees to come back to his apartment. Their encounter is the most strangely extraordinary of his life. Propelled by uncontrollable, primordial desires, he enters a new and unimagined dimension of the forbidden and is filled with a sexual and spiritual ecstasy that is as intense as it is unholy.<br><br>Suddenly Nick's senses are alive. He feels strong, unconquerable, beyond all inhibition and earthly morality. He indulges in life's pleasures, pure and perverse, sublime and dangerous, from the delicate flavors of the perfect tomato to the fleshy beauty of a woman's thigh. But Nick's desire to sustain his rapture leads him to a madness and a darkness far greater and dreadful than have ever ridden the demon mares of night.<br><br>Writing in a lineage that includes Dante, William S. Burroughs, Charles Bukowski, Hubert Selby, Jr., and Hunter S. Thompson, Nick Tosches may be America's last real literary outlaw-a fearless, uncensorable seeker of our deepest secret truths and desires, from the basest to the most beautiful. <i>Me and the Devil</i> is outrageous, disturbing, and brilliant, a raw and blazing novel truly unlike any other. Like the man said: Read him at your peril.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2012</strong>: Once upon a time--before heartthrob bloodsuckers sparkled in the sunlight of chaste daydreams--vampires meant sex and danger, blood and animal, Victorian taboo made <i>un</i>flesh, scratching at your windows in the small hours. In <i>Me and the Devil</i>, Nick Tosches doesn&#x2019;t quite reach back to the Gothic (though he may reach for the Gnostic, if you want to dig into the seedier details) with his tale of an aging writer--a decrepit Drac of the New York night--who discovers rejuvenation in the femoral blood of his willing female complements. His book is so packed with grit, vice, and gore as to make it a queasy recommendation for unsuspecting readers, but if you think you&#x2019;re ready, go for it. <i>Me and the Devil</i> is a throwback to the fearless writing of William Burroughs, Jim Carroll, and Richard Hell, a book heedless of boundaries and conscience. <i>--Jon Foro</i>Nick Tosches is uniquely acquainted with the half-lit New York world in which this novel is set.

From the selfless ant to the stinging bee to the man laying down his life for a stranger, evolution has yielded a goodness that in theory should never be.<br><br> Set against the sweeping tale of 150 years of scientific attempts to explain kindness, <em>The Price of Altruism</em> tells for the first time the moving story of the eccentric American genius George Price (1922&#x2013;1975), as he strives to answer evolution's greatest riddle. An original and penetrating picture of twentieth century thought, it is also a deeply personal journey. From the heights of the Manhattan Project to the inspired equation that explains altruism to the depths of homelessness and despair, Price's life embodies the paradoxes of Darwin&#x2019;s enigma. His tragic suicide in a squatter&#x2019;s flat, among the vagabonds to whom he gave all his possessions, provides the ultimate contemplation on the possibility of genuine benevolence. 24 Illustrations</p><p>Oren Harman, who has a doctorate from Oxford University, is the Chair of the Graduate Program in Science Technology and Society at Bar Ilan University and a professor of the history of science.

She retraces the history of the Atlantic slave trade from the fifteenth to the twentieth century and reckons with the blank slate of her own genealogy.<br>There were no survivors of Hartman's lineage, nor far-flung relatives in Ghana of whom she had come in search. She traveled to Ghana in search of strangers. The most universal definition of the slave is a stranger--torn from kin and country. To lose your mother is to suffer the loss of kin, to forget your past, and to inhabit the world as a stranger. As both the offspring of slaves and an American in Africa, Hartman, too, was a stranger. Her reflections on history and memory unfold as an intimate encounter with places--a holding cell, a slave market, a walled town built<br>to repel slave raiders--and with people: an Akan prince who granted the Portuguese permission to build the first permanent trading fort in West Africa; an adolescent boy who was kidnapped while playing; a fourteen-year-old girl who was murdered aboard a slave ship.<br>Eloquent, thoughtful, and deeply affecting, <i>Lose Your Mother </i>is a powerful meditation on history, memory, and the Atlantic slave trade.<br><br></p><p>Saidiya Hartman is the author of <i>Scenes of Subjection</i>: <i>Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in the Nineteenth-Century America</i>.

It was sharp and clear, as it rang in the air, and clattered in my ear making me recoil. Obruni. A stranger. A foreigner from across the sea. Three children gathered at the bus station shouted it, giggling as it erupted from their mouths, tickled to have spotted some extraterrestrial fallen to earth in Ghana. They summoned me, "obruni, obruni," as if it were a form of akwaaba (welcome), reserved just for me. As the words weaved their way through the crowd and landed on me, I imagined myself in their eyes: an alien tightly wrapped in the skin of a blue rain slicker, the big head bursting from its navy pod.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My appearance confirmed it: I was the proverbial outsider. Who else sported vinyl in the tropics? My customs belonged to another country: my too-fast gait best suited to navigating the streets of Manhattan, my unfashionable German walking shoes, my unruly tufts twisted into two French braids, fuzzy and unfurling in the humid air. Old and new worlds stamped my face, a blend of peoples and nations and masters and slaves long forgotten. In the jumble of my features, no certain line of origin could be traced. Clearly, I was not Fanti, or Ashanti, or Ewe, or Ga.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I started to hear it everywhere. It was the buzz in the market. It was the shorthand my new Ghanaian friends used to describe me to their old friends. Obruni lurked like an undertone in the hustle of street peddlers. People said it casually in my face, until I sucked my teeth and said "ehh!" informing the speaker that first, I knew what the word meant, and second, I didn't relish the label.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then I learned to accept it. After all, I was a stranger from across the sea. A black face didn't make me kin. Even when otherwise undetected, I was betrayed when I opened my mouth and heard my father's Brooklyn brogue rippling across the surface of my studied speech, wreaking havoc with the regimented syntax enforced by my mother the grammarian, whose scrupulous speech was a way of masking her southern origins and blending into New York. My direct way of speaking sounded sharp-edged and angular when compared to the tactful evasion and obliging indirection of the local English idiom. The brisk clip of my speech, flattened vowels, and sounds trapped in the dome of my mouth, expiring from lack of air, branded me the foreigner.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was the stranger in the village, a wandering seed bereft of the possibility of taking root. Behind my back people whispered, dua ho mmire: a mushroom that grows on the tree has no deep soil. Everyone avoided the word "slave," but we all knew who was who. As a "slave baby," I represented what most chose to avoid: the catastrophe that was our past, and the lives exchanged for India cloth, Venetian beads, cowrie shells, guns, and rum. And what was forbidden to discuss: the matter of someone's origins.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obruni forced me to acknowledge that I didn't belong anyplace. The domain of the stranger is always an elusive elsewhere. I was born in another country, where I also felt like an alien and which in part determined why I had come to Ghana. I had grown weary of being stateless. Secretly I wanted to belong somewhere or, at least, I wanted a convenient explanation of why I felt like a stranger.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child, when I was angry with my mother and father, I'd conjure up glorious imaginary parents who'd rescue me from the awful people forcing me to call them Mom and Dad. I often imagined that the singer Johnny Hartman was my father since we shared the same last name. Whenever my dad played his Coltrane albums, I listened for Johnny Hartman's lovely wistful voice. If I didn't think too hard about why he had abandoned me, I could find succor in this fiction of origins. The sting of obruni allowed for no such fiction.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I complained to an expatriate friend living in Accra that I had never felt as much a stranger as I did in Ghana. He muttered, "uh-huh," and then he asked, "When you go to Chicago, do you expect black folks there to welcome you because you're from New York? Well, why should it be any different here?"<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The most universal definition of the slave is a stranger. Torn from kin and community, exiled from one's country, dishonored and violated, the slave defines the position of the outsider. She is the perpetual outcast, the coerced migrant, the foreigner, the shamefaced child in the lineage. Contrary to popular belief, Africans did not sell their brothers and sisters into slavery. They sold strangers: those outside the web of kin and clan relationships, nonmembers of the polity, foreigners and barbarians at the outskirts of their country, and lawbreakers expelled from society. In order to betray your race, you had first to imagine yourself as one. The language of race developed in the modern period and in the context of the slave trade.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very term "slavery" derived from the word "Slav," because Eastern Europeans were the slaves of the medieval world. At the beginning of modernity, slavery declined in Europe as it expanded in Africa, although as late as the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was still possible to purchase "white" slaves--English, Spanish, and Portuguese captives in the Mediterranean ports of North Africa. The Iberians can be credited, according to one historian, "for restricting bondage, for the first time in history to peoples of African descent." It was not until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that the line between the slave and the free separated Africans and Europeans and hardened into a color line.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Europeans, race established a hierarchy of human life, determined which persons were expendable, and selected the bodies that could be transformed into commodities. For those chained in the lower decks of a slave ship, race was both a death sentence and the language of solidarity. The vision of an African continental family or a sable race standing shoulder to shoulder was born by captives, exiles, and orphans and in the aftermath of the Atlantic slave trade. Racial solidarity was expressed in the language of kinship because it both evidenced the wound and attempted to heal it. The slave and the ex-slave wanted what had been severed: kin. Those in the diaspora translated the story of race into one of love and betrayal.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I had come to Ghana in search of strangers. The first time for a few weeks in the summer of 1996 as a tourist interested in the slave forts hunkered along the coast and the second time for a year beginning in the fall of 1997 as a Fulbright Scholar affiliated with the National Museum of Ghana. Ghana was as likely a place as any to begin my journey, because I wasn't seeking the ancestral village but the barracoon. As both a professor conducting research on slavery and a descendant of the enslaved, I was desperate to reclaim the dead, that is, to reckon with the lives undone and obliterated in the making of human commodities.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to engage the past, knowing that its perils and dangers still threatened and that even now lives hung in the balance. Slavery had established a measure of man and a ranking of life and worth that has yet to be undone. If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America, it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the burden of a too-long memory, but because black lives are still imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago. This is the afterlife of slavery--skewed life chances, limited access to health and education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment. I, too, am the afterlife of slavery.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine slave routes traversed Ghana. In following the trail of captives from the hinterland to the Atlantic coast, I intended to retrace the process by which lives were destroyed and slaves born. I stepped into the path of more than seven hundred thousand captives, passing through the coastal merchant societies that acted as middlemen and brokers in the slave trade, the inland warrior aristocracies that captured people and supplied slaves to the coast, and the northern societies that were raided and plundered. I visited the European forts and storehouses on the three-hundred-mile stretch of the littoral from Beyin to Keta, the slave markets established by strong inland states that raided their enemies and subordinates and profited from the trade, and the fortified towns and pillaged communities of the hinterland that provided the steady flow of captives.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose Ghana because it possessed more dungeons, prisons, and slave pens than any other country in West Africa--tight dark cells buried underground, barred cavernous cells, narrow cylindrical cells, dank cells, makeshift cells. In the rush for gold and slaves that began at the end of the fifteenth century, the Portuguese, English, Dutch, French, Danes, Swedes, and Brandenburgers (Germans) built fifty permanent outposts, forts, and castles designed to ensure their place in the Africa trade. In these dungeons, storerooms, and holding cells, slaves were imprisoned until transported across the Atlantic.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nbs...</p><h2>Technology In the Ancient World</h2><p>An illustrated account of the development of technology from its origins to the end of the period of Roman domination in the early fifth century AD, looking at agriculture, navigation and overland transportation, city construction, war and domestic life.</p><p></p><h2>Walt Disney Animation Studios The Archive Series #1: Story</h2><p><br>With an introduction by John Lasseter&#x2014;and very little else in the way of words&#x2014;this first book in <i>The Artist Series</i> lavishly showcases the most brilliant story artwork created by such luminaries as Bill Peet, Don DaGradi, Joe Rinaldi, Roy Williams, Ub Iwerks, Burny Mattison, and Vance Gerry for such films as <i>Steamboat Willie</i> and <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> to <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and <i>101 Dalmatians</i>.

Her writing has also appeared in The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal, Glamour, Allure, Real Simple<i>,</i> and New York magazine, among others. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br></p>1947<br> &nbsp;<br> Frances poured the last bitter remains of the coffeepot into her cup. The small kitchen table was covered in paper: layouts, copies of confidential reports, lousy ideas she had scrapped hours ago, and good ones, already published in <i>Look, Vogue, The Saturday Evening Post, Life, </i>and <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar, </i>to remind her that she had done it before and could do it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> For once, the apartment building was silent. Usually, from off in some distant corner she could hear a baby crying, a couple arguing, a toilet flushing. But it was past three a.m. The revelers had long been asleep, and the milkmen weren&#x2019;t yet awake.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her roommate had gone to bed around ten&#x2014; at the sight of her standing there in her nightgown and curlers, Frances was overcome with professional jealousy, even though Ann was only a secretary in a law office, who would spend tomorrow the same way she spent every day, fetching coffee and taking dictation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frances had just finished writing the newest De Beers copy, a honeymoon series with pictures of pretty places newlyweds might go&#x2014; <i>the rocky coast of Maine! Arizona! Paris! </i>And something generic for people without much money, which she labeled <i>By the river.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In a way, that one was the most important of them all, since they were trying to appeal to the average Joe. A decade earlier, when De Beers first came on as a client, the agency had done a lot of surveying to find out the strength&#x2014; or really the weakness&#x2014; of the diamond engagement ring tradition. In those days, not many women had wanted one. It was considered just absolutely money down the drain. They&#x2019;d take a washing machine or a new car, anything but an expensive diamond ring. She had helped to<br> change all that.<br> &nbsp;<br> The honeymoon ads read, <i>May your happiness last as long as your diamond</i>. A pretty good line, she thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Time for bed, Frank,&#x201d; she whispered to herself, the same words her mother had whispered to her every night when she was a child.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was just about to switch off the light when she saw the blank signature line that the art director had drawn on the layouts, which she was meant to fill in by morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rats.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Frances sat back down, lit a cigarette, and picked up a pencil.<br> &nbsp;<br> A day earlier, Gerry Lauck, head of the New York office, had called her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think we should have something that identifies this as diamond advertising,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A signature line. What do you think?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Gerry Lauck asked what you thought, it was wise to understand that he was not actually asking. In her opinion, the man was a genius. Unpredictable and a bit gloomy at times, but perhaps all geniuses were like that.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, perfect,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gerry looked like Winston Churchill, he acted like Winston Churchill, and sometimes Frances believed he thought he <i>was </i>Winston Churchill. He even had fits of depression. The first time she had to go to New York to show him her ideas, she was scared to death. Gerry looked them over, his face giving no indication of what he thought. After several torturous minutes, he smiled and said, &#x201c;Frances, you write beautifully. More&nbsp;important, you know how to sell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They had liked each other ever since. Half the employees of N. W. Ayer were afraid of Gerry Lauck, or couldn&#x2019;t stand him. The other half thought he hung the moon, and Frances was one of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The line shouldn&#x2019;t say anything about De Beers, of course,&#x201d; Gerry continued over the phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For nine years, De Beers had spent millions on ads that barely mentioned the company itself. To even name it as a distributor would be breaking the law. So the advertisements were simply for diamonds, and they were beautiful. Ayer pulled out all the stops. They couldn&#x2019;t show pictures of diamond jewelry in the ads, which left the art department in a pickle. In theory, Gerry had nothing to do with creative. He was a straight-up&nbsp;businessman and just handed out the assignments. But as an art lover, he thought to commission a series of original paintings from Lucioni, Berman, Lamotte, and Dame Laura Knight. He purchased preexisting works from some of the finest galleries in Europe for the De Beers collection, by Dal�, Picasso, and Edzard.<br> &nbsp;<br> The resulting four- color ads showed gorgeous landscapes, cities, cathedrals. Printed on the page, just below the artist&#x2019;s creation, would be a box displaying illustrations of stones, ranging from half a carat to three carats, along with approximate prices for each. Gerry was the first person to create an ad campaign featuring fine art. A year or two later, everyone in the business was doing it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need the tagline by tomorrow,&#x201d; Gerry said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in to Philadelphia in the morning and then on to South Africa by late afternoon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sure thing,&#x201d; Frances said, and then promptly forgot all about it until now, the middle of the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> She sighed. If she hadn&#x2019;t been bucking all her life for the title of World&#x2019;s Biggest Procrastinator, maybe she &#x2019;d get some sleep one of these days. She knew she had to work tonight, but still she had stayed out with her pal Dorothy Dignam until Dorothy had to catch the nine o&#x2019;clock train back to Penn Station.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dorothy started as an Ayer copywriter in the Philadelphia office in 1930, but soon after Frances came to the agency four years back, Dorothy moved to the New York office at 30 Rockefeller Center to head up the public relations department. Like Frances, De Beers was her main priority. They had publicists in Miami, Hollywood, and Paris, too, just for this one client. Dorothy had even arranged for the creation of a short film&nbsp;with Columbia Pictures, <i>The Magic Stone: Diamonds Through the Centuries</i>. It started playing in theaters in September 1945 and by the time the run was over, it had been seen by more than fifteen million people.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her friend would never tell her age, but Frances guessed that Dorothy was at least a decade and a half older than she was, probably about fifty. She had been in advertising in Chicago in the last year of the First World War. She was the <i>Chicago Herald&#x2019;</i>s society reporter at seventeen years old and stayed until the day Mr. Hearst moved in and moved her out. She went from there to the offices of the Contented Cow milk company as a copywriter, and later to Ayer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dorothy was a real hot ticket. She was something of a model for Frances. She had traveled the world for Ayer in the thirties, working in London, Paris, and Geneva for Ford, sailing to Norway and Sweden to study household electrical progress. She even made frequent visits to Hollywood, where she went to the Trocadero for dinner and saw all the stars. She once ran into Joan Crawford in Bullocks Wilshire. Dorothy bought&nbsp;size 16 of the dress that Joan had purchased in size 14. <i>Just an inexpensive black daytime frock and very useful to both of us, I&#x2019;m sure </i>was how she had described it in a postcard she sent.<br> &nbsp;<br> Their dinner tonight had started off as a business meeting, but after two martinis each they were laughing uproariously at a table at Bookbinder&#x2019;s, eating oysters and telling jokes about the fellas at work. They were endlessly amused by the things they were expected to know as women in the office. A few years ago, Dorothy started keeping a sheet of paper in the vacant drawer under her typewriter, and every question that was asked of her, she typed down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tonight, she had read Frances a few of the latest: &#x201c;How should a woman look when her son is seventeen? Could a winter hat have a bird&#x2019;s nest on it? Is Macy&#x2019;s singular or plural? Do women ever warble in the bathtub? What&#x2019;s the difference between suede and buck? Does Queen Mary have a nice complexion? How many times a day do you feed a baby? Is this thing an inverted pleat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They had had a ball, but now Frances would have to pay the price. <br> &nbsp;<br> She glanced at a sheet of paper, a recent strategy plan, and read, <i>We are dealing primarily with a problem in mass psychology. We seek to maintain and strengthen the tradition of the diamond engagement ring&#x2014; to make it a psychological necessity. Target audience: some seventy million people fifteen years and over whose opinion we hope to influence in support of our objectives.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Well, that narrowed it down nicely.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1938, a representative of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, president of De Beers Consolidated Mines, wrote to Ayer to inquire whether, as he put it, &#x201c;the use of propaganda in various forms&#x201d; might boost the sales of diamonds in America.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Depression had caused diamond prices to plummet around the world. Consumer interest had all but vanished. There were only half as many diamonds sold in America as there had been before the war, and the few diamond engagement rings still being purchased were inexpensive and small. De Beers had reserve stocks they couldn&#x2019;t possibly sell. Oppenheimer was eager to bring the diamond engagement ring to prominence in the United States, and he had it on good authority that Ayer was the best in the business, the only agency for the job. He proposed a campaign at $500,000 annually for the first three years.<br> &nbsp;<br> What Ayer had done for De Beers was a true testament to the power of advertising. By 1941, diamond sales had increased by 55 percent. After the Second World War, the number of weddings in America soared, and diamonds went right along with them. The price of diamonds went up, too: Today, a two- carat diamond could range in price from $1,500 to $3,300. In 1939, it would have been $900 to $1,750.<br> &nbsp;<br> They had created a whole new sort of advertising for this campaign, and other agencies had been copying it ever since. In the absence of a direct sale to be made, or a brand name to be introduced, there was only an idea: the emotional currency attached to a diamond.<br> &nbsp;<br> De Beers produced less than they could, to keep supply low and price high. Not only did their advertising approach boost sales, it also ensured that, once sold, a diamond would never return to the marketplace. After Frances got finished pulling their heartstrings, widows or even divorc�es would not want to part with their rings.<br> &nbsp;<br> On occasion over the years, she had imagined what the Oppenheimers must look like. The peculiar particulars of their relationship stoked her imagination, making her wonder what their faces did when they saw her newest ideas. Were there raised eyebrows? Slight smiles? Exclamations?<br> &nbsp;<br> It was unusual for her not to have met a client, but De Beers was prohibited from coming to the United States because of the cartel. The company controlled the world supply of rough diamonds, a monopoly so strong that the mere presence of its representatives in America violated the law. They operated out of Johannesburg and London. Once a year, Gerry Lauck took the ads she wrote to South Africa in a thick leatherbound book for their approval. He kept a set of golf clubs there, since it was easier than lugging them back and forth from New York.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fi rst time Gerry went to Johannesburg to present market research to the Oppenheimers, the small seaplane he was traveling on made a crash landing off the Island of Mozambique. He used the large mounted maps and charts he had brought along as flotation devices to get to shore. Two others on board died, and <i>The New York Times </i>ran the headline airliner is wrecked in southeast africa: american escapes injury. Gerry felt that the presentation quite literally saved his life, and perhaps for that reason, he was willing to do whatever it took for De Beers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her roommate let out a great snore in the next room, interrupting Frances&#x2019;s thoughts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ann was waiting on a marriage proposal from a dull accountant she had been dating for a while now. After that, Frances would be back on the hunt for a new roommate, as had tended to happen every few months or so since the war ended. Rose, Myrtle, Hildy: one by one, she had lost them all to matrimony. But she was up for a promotion at the office, so perhaps when Ann left she could finally afford to live alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Frances started working at Ayer four years ago, at the age of twenty- eight, she had convinced her parents that it was time for her to move away from home and into the city. But her paycheck demanded that she get a roommate to help with the rent. She wanted a house of her own on the Main Line. Then she &#x2019;d never have to worry about getting enough hot water in the shower on winter mornings, or tolerating Ann&#x2019;s nasally&nbsp;soprano as she accompanied Dinah Shore on the radio at night. She relished and &nbsp;reamed about the prospect of living alone, the same way most&nbsp;single girls probably dreamed about married life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frances ran a finger over one of her new honeymoon ads. Other women never seemed to think about what came next. They were so eager to be paired up, as if marriage was known to be full of splendor. Frances was the opposite: she could never stop thinking about it. She might go to dinner or out dancing with someone new, and have a fi ne time. But when she got home and climbed into bed afterward, her heart would race with&nbsp;fear. If she went out with him again, then they might go out again after that. Eventually, she would have to take him home to be evaluated by her parents, and vice versa. Then he would propose. And she, like all the other working girls who had married before her, would simply disappear into a life of motherhood and isolation.</p><h2>Trustee from the Toolroom</h2><p>Paperback: 316 pages Publisher: House of Stratus Ltd (January 1, 2001) Language: English ISBN-10: 1842323016 ISBN-13: 978-1842323014 Product Dimensions: 5.5 x 1 x 8.2 inches Shipping Weight: 13.4 ounces</p><p>NEVIL SHUTE NORWAY was born on January 17, 1899 in Ealing, London.

Beleaguered by internal strife and sickness, the passengers and crew of the <i>Mayflower</i> arrived in Plymouth ill-equipped to last the winter. With the help of several Indians who befriended the settlers, many survived, although a number of them died. Viewed through the eyes of 14-year-old Jasper, who records the events of his first 15 months in America in his journal, the Pilgrims' experiences take on a fresh, current feel. Although Jasper is a fictional character, the other characters in the story were real people, and the events are soundly based on factual accounts. Encounters with Pilgrim bullies, the suicide of one woman, and blow-by-blow details of the hardships endured make this an exciting, intelligent addition to the excellent My Name Is America series. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Grade 4-8-This offering follows the series' design of a diary format that features fictional characters in a historical setting. In this case, a 14-year-old indentured servant records his experiences aboard the Mayflower and his first year in the New World. Based on research and Rinaldi's own interpretations, this title puts flesh and blood on such historical characters as Governor Bradford, John Alden, Priscilla Mullens, and Miles Standish. The hardships the Pilgrims survived on both ship and land are realistically portrayed. This title will be a good companion to Kathryn Lasky's A Journey to the New World (Scholastic, 1996), which covers much of the same material from a girl's point of view. A section of historical notes and drawings is included.<br><i>Eunice Weech, M. L.

When it was first published in 1918, it became an instant bestseller and went on to win the Pulitzer Prize. More than eighty years later, in an age of self-reflection and exhaustive memoirs, The Education still stands as perhaps the greatest American autobiography. The son of a diplomat, the grandson and great-grandson of two American presidents, a man of extraordinary gifts and learning in his own right, Henry Adams recounts his life from his birth in 1838 and upbringing as a Boston Brahmin, through the Civil War, the nation&#39;s industrial expansion, and its emergence as a world power. In the process, he gives us a brilliant history of a changing country as well as a thoughtful, humane, often tender exploration of himself. From the original publisher, this edition of The Education of Henry Adams, newly introduced by Donald Hall, celebrates and honors this classic work on what it means to be an American.</p><p>Many great artists have had at least intermittent doubts about their own abilities. But <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> is surely one of the few masterpieces to issue directly from a raging inferiority complex. The author, to be sure, had bigger shoes to fill than most of us. Both his grandfather and great-grandfather were U.S. presidents. His father, a relative underachiever, scraped by as a member of Congress and ambassador to the Court of St. James. But young Henry, born in Boston in 1838, was destined for a walk-on role in his nation's history--and seemed alarmingly aware of the fact from the time he was an adolescent.<p> It gets worse. For the author could neither match his exalted ancestors nor dismiss them as dusty relics--he was an Adams, after all, formed from the same 18th-century clay. "The atmosphere of education in which he lived was colonial," we are told, </p><blockquote>revolutionary, almost Cromwellian, as though he were steeped, from his greatest grandmother's birth, in the odor of political crime. Resistance to something was the law of New England nature; the boy looked out on the world with the instinct of resistance; for numberless generations his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be reformed, filled with evil forces to be abolished, and they saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition; the duty was unchanged.</blockquote> Here, as always, Adams tells his story in a third-person voice that can seem almost extraplanetary in its detachment. Yet there's also an undercurrent of melancholy and amusement--and wonder at the specific details of what was already a lost world.<p> Continuing his uphill conquest of the learning curve, Adams attended Harvard, which didn't do much for him. ("The chief wonder of education is that it does not ruin everybody concerned in it, teachers and taught.") Then, after a beer-and-sausage-scented spell as a graduate student in Berlin, he followed his father to Washington, D.C., in 1860. There he might have remained--bogged down in "the same rude colony ... camped in the same forest, with the same unfinished Greek temples for workrooms, and sloughs for roads"--had not the Civil War sent Adams <i>p�re et fils</i> to London. Henry sat on the sidelines throughout the conflict, serving as his father's private secretary and anxiously negotiating the minefields of English society. He then returned home and commenced a long career as a journalist, historian, novelist, and peripheral participant in the political process--a kind of mouthpiece for what remained of the New England conscience.</p><p> He was not, by any measure but his own, a failure. And the proof of the pudding is <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> itself, which remains among the oddest and most enlightening books in American literature. It contains thousands of memorable one-liners about politics, morality, culture, and transatlantic relations: "The American mind exasperated the European as a buzz-saw might exasperate a pine forest." There are astonishing glimpses of the high and mighty: "He saw a long, awkward figure; a plain, ploughed face; a mind, absent in part, and in part evidently worried by white kid gloves; features that expressed neither self-satisfaction nor any other familiar Americanism..." (That would be Abraham Lincoln; the "melancholy function" his Inaugural Ball.) But most of all, Adams's book is a brilliant account of how his own sensibility came to be. A literary landmark from the moment it first appeared, the <i>Autobiography</i> confers upon its author precisely that prize he felt had always eluded him: success. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>'I cannot remember when I was not fascinated by Henry Adams, ' said Gore Vidal. 'He was remarkably prescient about the coming horrors.' <br>His political ideals shaped by two presidential ancestors--great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams--Henry Adams was one of the most powerful and original minds to confront the American scene from the Civil War to the First World War. <br>Printed privately in 1907 and published to wide acclaim shortly after the author&amp;'s death in 1918, The Education of Henry Adams is a brilliant, idiosyncratic blend of autobiography and history that charts the great transformation in American life during the so-called Gilded Age. <br>With an introduction by renowned historian Edmund Morris.</p><h2>Atomic Robo Volume 7: Flying She-Devils of the Pacific</h2><p><ul> <li>Invented by Nikola Tesla in 1923, Atomic Robo went on to be a soldier, a scientist, an entrepreneur, and an explorer whose adventures span the globe.

His career began at age 26 after he won his father&#x2019;s Congressional seat, serving his Tennessee district for ten years. He stepped into the national spotlight with his electric keynote at the 2000 Democratic National Convention, and in 2006 his reputation was further shaped during the closest Senate race in Tennessee&#x2019;s history, which he lost. Ford feels passionately that our country&#x2019;s best days are ahead, and in <i>More Davids Than Goliaths</i>, he presents his mission statement for America. <br><br>Reflecting on what he&#x2019;s learned from his extended political family, the slings and arrows of the campaign trail, and those across our nation who inspire him, <i>More Davids Than Goliaths</i> explains Ford&#x2019;s conviction, &#x201c;At its best, leadership in government can solve, inspire, and heal.&#x201d; Along the way, Ford reminds us that in America, there are more Davids than Goliaths, more solutions than problems, more that unites us than divides us.</p><p><p><b>Harold Ford, Jr.,</b> is an executive vice chairman at Bank of America in New York.

He and his wife, Emily, live in Manhattan.</p><p><b>THE APPRENTICE</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>This is Harold Ford, Jr., and I&#x2019;m campaigning for my daddy for Congress. If you want a better house to live in, better schools to go to, and lower cookie prices, vote for my daddy.&#x201d; I made my first political ad when I was four years old. It was 1974, and my father was running for Congress. My mom propped me up on a brown folding table at the back of my dad&#x2019;s campaign headquarters and I spoke into a microphone attached to a cassette recorder.<br>&nbsp;<br>I did it in one take.<br>&nbsp;<br>Politics was ingrained in me early. It was part of me in the best of ways. For my entire life, I&#x2019;ve met and heard people, especially other politicians, talk about how they started early in politics by handing out leaflets, brochures, and so on. My start in politics was equally honest&#x2014;a commercial for my dad on his first congressional campaign. In a lot of ways, politics was&#x2014;and remains&#x2014;a part of my genetic makeup, and, for that matter, so was my party identification. I learned to be a Democrat the old-fashioned way: I was told that I was going to be one by my father and mother.<br>&nbsp;<br>The campaign headquarters was a comfortable setting for me. I was there almost every day. My folks would pick me up at preschool and take me to the headquarters, where I delighted in the hustle and bustle and the steady inrush and outrush of staff and volunteers. For as long as I can remember, I&#x2019;ve loved being around people.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a kid, I always felt comfortable around adults. I didn&#x2019;t necessarily prefer adults over my peers, but sitting with, listening to, and talking in front of adults never really bothered me or made me nervous. I wasn&#x2019;t overconfident or anything like that. But I wasn&#x2019;t lacking confidence&#x2014;I get that from both my mom and my dad. Nor was I different from other kids my age in that I enjoyed and played sports. It was more that I wanted to be a part of the conversation&#x2014;I wanted to help in any way I could. I felt a particular but unarticulated closeness to the politics surrounding me&#x2014;perhaps because it was my family involved and my dad&#x2019;s name on the ballot.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few days after I made the ad, I heard it on the radio. I was sitting between my parents in the car. My mother smiled. My father grinned. I remember, at a precocious moment, thinking at the time, &#x201c;I enjoy talking, and I really enjoy talking about campaigning.&#x201d; Although I didn&#x2019;t appreciate what exactly my dad was going to do to get people better homes and kids better schools, I knew he was going to try. <br>&nbsp;<br>After the ad, I started going to more and more campaign events with my parents. It isn&#x2019;t uncommon for politicians to introduce their families or even to ask their families to join them onstage while they are speaking. And my dad would often do that. He would sometimes allow me to introduce him, and I often repeated my line from the radio ad. The cookie line was my favorite line in the introduction&#x2014;my mother drafted that line. When introducing my dad, I always committed the additional lines to memory. I never used notes or read from a prepared text&#x2014;even to this day, I don&#x2019;t use prepared remarks. I will sometimes refer to notes, but never a written speech. I don&#x2019;t use prepared remarks primarily because I find them hard to read with passion, sincerity, and force.<br>&nbsp;<br>I remember speaking at one of my father&#x2019;s congressional prayer breakfasts in Memphis when I was seven. My dad&#x2019;s speaker that year was his congressional colleague and my parents&#x2019; longtime friend Andrew Young. I helped introduce Congressman Young. I reminded the audience how much a role model Congressman Young was to people of all ages, especially for aspiring politicians like me. Prior to the speech, I remember going with my dad and some other politicians to meet with Congressman Young in his hotel in downtown Memphis. I sat at the dining room table in the hotel with Congressman Young and my dad as they discussed politics. I was just absorbing. My dad&#x2019;s focus was always people, especially hardworking poor people. My dad was listening closely to Congressman Young talk about how he and Maynard Jackson had built a black-white coalition in Atlanta premised on propelling black elected officials into high political offices and growing business opportunities for the entire Atlanta business community, including minority businesses. Memphis&#x2019;s persistent and pernicious occupation with race had prevented us from electing an African American mayor and widening sustainable business opportunities and growth to black businesses in the city. My dad&#x2019;s belief was that a racially diverse and successful Memphis business community was essential to better political and social cohesion in Memphis. One of the keys to realizing that dream was for the Memphis political landscape to become more racially and politically diverse first. Atlanta was a model for Memphis.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the things I learned from my dad at an early age about politics was never to allow jealousy, envy, or pettiness to get in the way of learning from a political peer. My dad inspired and taught a lot of politicians, younger and older, but he never shied away from learning himself. Andrew Young and Maynard Jackson are two southern politicians whom my dad respected and learned from.<br>&nbsp;<br>Growing up in a political household seemed normal because it&#x2019;s all I knew. There were three basic givens in the house for Jake, Isaac, and me. We had to do our homework every night, we had to go to church every Sunday (and oftentimes Sunday school), and we worked on political campaigns for my dad and my uncles.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was only one of those I genuinely enjoyed and relished&#x2014;campaigning. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, my parents didn&#x2019;t force us to campaign, but it was expected. And my brothers loved it as well. But with all the expectations placed on us to campaign, there were not concurrent expectations for us to enter politics. My parents would have been as pleased or satisfied if any of us had elected to become a doctor, a teacher, a journalist, a scientist, a cop, or a lawyer&#x2014;wherever our desires and abilities led us, they would have been fine with. Having said that, I don&#x2019;t remember a time when politics, public service, and campaigns didn&#x2019;t excite and drive me. Even after my parents moved us to Washington in 1979 during my dad&#x2019;s third term in Congress, I very much looked forward to returning to Memphis in the summers, especially election summers, to join the campaign. The work for me was primarily grassroots&#x2014;bumper stickering cars at shopping centers, putting up yard signs, and handing out campaign literature. The older I got, the more responsibility I was given. Eventually, I managed my dad&#x2019;s campaigns and was responsible for more of the organizational aspects of the campaigns. I wrote the text of the literature, spoke on my dad&#x2019;s behalf, organized fund-raising, and planned big events. But the grassroots work for me never stopped&#x2014;even after he&#x2019;d served ten terms in the Congress, my dad&#x2019;s commitment to grass-roots campaigning never waned. We would always start and finish the day shaking hands, slapping on bumper stickers, and taking pictures with constituents at shopping centers, grocery stores, malls, and busy intersections. My passion for and comfort with retail politics developed honestly. It might even be genetic.<br>&nbsp;<br>Every Sunday morning we had a ritual in the house. The arrangement was very straightforward&#x2014;if you ate breakfast, you went to church. I ate every Sunday morning. My mother would fry chicken, boil rice, and bake biscuits almost every Sunday. Even my Jewish friends who would sleep over would be required to go to church with us in Washington if they had breakfast. Although my family never disavowed our membership at our home church in Memphis (Mt. Moriah-East Baptist Church, which is where my brothers and I were baptized by Reverend Melvin Charles Smith), we were visiting members at two churches in Washington: New Bethel Baptist, pastured by Reverend Walter Fauntroy, who was also Washington, D.C.&#x2019;s delegate to Congress, and Metropolitan Baptist, pastured by Reverend H. Beecher Hicks. Initially, I was more comfortable in church in Memphis, but as we attended more and more services in D.C., I grew to love New Bethel and Metropolitan. Reverend Fauntroy was as good a gospel singer in the pulpit as he was a pastor. <br>&nbsp;<br>On the campaign trail in 1996 during my first run for Congress, I&#x2019;d often ask young parents where they attended church. I was often surprised by their answers, which can be best paraphrased as &#x201c;I go to New Salem, but I can&#x2019;t get my kids to go.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;I attend Olive Grove Baptist, but I can&#x2019;t get my kids to go.&#x201d; I was surprised, if not shocked, to hear this because when I was growing up, kids didn&#x2019;t have decision-making authority like that in any home that I knew of. Although eating breakfast was what triggered the requirement to go to church in my house, I always knew that even if I didn&#x2019;t eat breakfast, I was still going to church. In short, there was no opt-out provision in the Ford household.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes we even had to go to church during the week.<br>&nbsp;<br>When my parents were attending political and social events in the evenings, they would leave my brothers and me with one of the most wonderful families I&#x2019;ve ever known, the Ingrams. The Ingram girls, Lori and Debra, were our primary babysitters. Their mother, Mrs. Ingram, was the moral pillar of the household, and she insisted that everyone accompany her to Lambert Church of God in Christ on Wednesday nights. We knew that if we went to the Ingrams&#x2019; on a Wednesday night, we would be going to church. It didn&#x2019;t occur to us to argue. Wednesday night church wasn&#x2019;t ideal, since we had just gone to church three days earlier and were due again in church four days late...</p></p><h2>Floral Fantasy - In an Old English Garden - Illustrated by Walter Crane</h2><p><p>This book 'A Floral Fantasy In An Old English Garden' was originally published in 1899.

Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children. About the Illustrator: Walter Crane (1845-1915) was one of the earliest contributors to children's literature and one of the most influential illustrators in the development of childrens' colour picture books. Crane began working for Edmund Evans in 1864 producing bright, colourful children's books which revolutionised the type of children's books available. He created a series of 'Toy Books' between 1865-1875 which contained fairy stories, nursery rhymes and other tales of adventures.

Welcome to America.</p><p>Dad had little time to grieve, however, as the seven of us moved in with Mom&#x2019;s sister, Aunt Nancy, and her family in Lenox in the Berkshires. Uncle Joe, a much-respected principal at Lenox High School, quickly found Dad two jobs&#x2014;one in a textile mill and the other on a construction site, digging foundations.</p><p>With his native gregariousness, it wasn&#x2019;t long before Dad caught wind of a janitorial position in St. Charles parish in Pittsfield, a modest city a dozen miles north of the village of Lenox. The job didn&#x2019;t pay well, but it came with living quarters&#x2014;a great incentive for a growing family trying to establish a foothold in a new land. This Irish parish consisted of church, rectory, convent, and a grammar school that his young brood could attend, less than a football field&#x2019;s distance from their new home.</p><p>"Why not the GE?" someone suggested. At that time in Pittsfield, the county seat and so-called heart of the Berkshires in the far western hills of Massachusetts, General Electric employed nearly 8,500 residents in a city of sixty thousand. No wonder everyone invariably referred to it as "the GE." Dad&#x2019;s experience working at a power plant in En gland might have served him well, but he wanted to start anew, and he could imagine no better place to do so than the house of God.</p><p>So, that long-ago autumn of 1953, our family took up residence in the drafty caretaker&#x2019;s quarters behind the rectory of St. Charles, bracing ourselves for our first harsh winter. Upstairs in this small dwelling lived Mrs. Durette, a pious little woman of French Canadian birth with a large heart. Her rocking chair by the window faced the church&#x2019;s high steeple. She explained to us children that the golden cross atop the steeple was as tall as any man in the parish, though it appeared no larger than the crucifix on the prayer beads in her lap.</p><p>After supper we would assist Mrs. Durette down the rickety staircase to watch westerns on our big-console, small-screen black-and-white TV, kindly left to us by the former custodian. She was a friend to our family and a comfort to our mom. One morning that first winter, as a heavy snowstorm blanketed Nobility Hill, the old and incongruous name for our neighborhood, Mom and Mrs. Durette looked out at Dad, bent low with an old coal shovel, clearing heavy wet snow from the sidewalks and steps of rectory and church, and up both sides of Pontoosuc Avenue to the convent and school. "Jimmy&#x2019;s no janitor," she consoled my fretful mother with a hug. "No, your Jimmy&#x2019;s a gem."</p><p>My brothers and I would often accompany Dad on his daily chores. In the summer months we&#x2019;d play tic-tac-toe on classroom blackboards while he polished the wooden floors to a lustrous gleam. In winter we&#x2019;d stand back and shield our faces as he shoveled mountains of black sooty coal into the fire-breathing furnaces with blistered hands.</p><p>On Saturdays we&#x2019;d help out in the church, filling vestibule fonts with holy water and straightening missals and songbooks in the pews. Chores done, we&#x2019;d venture up to the choir loft where, blinded by the light streaming through the stained-glass rose window, we&#x2019;d giddily play in a kaleidoscope of colors until Dad, sloshing a mop of soapy water in the long aisles below, would glare up and hush us with a sshh! that echoed through the high Gothic arches.</p><p>My dad rang the church bell at masses, weddings, and funerals, and tolled the Angelus morning, noon, and night. He&#x2019;d unlock the bell closet, take grip of the thick rope, and with firm pull and steady hold&#x2014;lest the bell double-clang&#x2014;pour out the mellow-toned "voice of God" over the parish.</p><p>Parishioners praised his bell ringing, especially at Christmas, when the merry and sleepy-eyed shuffled into midnight Mass. "Jimmy, you can make that bell sing," they&#x2019;d say. "Solemn at funerals, joyous at weddings, and magical on Christmas night."</p><p>"It&#x2019;s a knack you have," another man chimed in, as he and his family stood back to admire Dad working the ropes. "You should be ringing the bells at St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral."</p><p>Of course, we too loved to ring the bell, like tonsured monks of old. Dad would hold our hands between his own, and after one mighty tug the rope would lift us clear off the floor, as the bell resounded to the heavens.</p><p>There was no clowning around on the bell rope, however. Dad called it "God&#x2019;s work," explaining that the Angelus, which echoed the Ave Maria of Our Lady&#x2019;s Annunciation, had been calling Catholics to prayer three times daily since medieval times. The Angelus peals in a rhythm of 3-3-3-9, and Dad rang its sequence with impeccable timing, reciting the Hail Mary in Irish for deeper devotion.</p><p>A few years later, when Dad was no longer janitor, but still rang the bell, my friend Michael Nichols and I discovered a secret passage in the choir loft that led to the bell tower itself. Daring to enter, we climbed wooden steps that creaked and spiraled toward the stuffy confines of the belfry, but quickly retreated at a loud clap of pigeons above. But the next Saturday we reached the one last ladder and emerged into the daylight of the belfry, ducking low in fear Father Foley&#x2014;or worse still, my dad&#x2014;would spot us amid the commotion of pigeons.</p><p>On that spring morning, Michael and I crouched behind the railings and surveyed our dominion as if from a castle parapet. We looked down upon the gnarly woods and dark flowing river to the west, and sent a signal to our ally in the south, the glistening blue limestone spire of St. Joseph Church. We circled the bell and boldly ran our fingers over its Roman numerals&#x2014;MDCCCXCIX, laboriously calculated to 1899&#x2014;and its given name, Maria et Julia, etched on the curved surface.</p><p>Before descending, I reached underneath the massively heavy bell to grasp its metal tongue, which burned with cold fire. Afraid that I had profaned the holy object with a touch that might corrode the bell&#x2019;s shining ring into a rasp, the next Saturday I confessed my wrongdoing to Father Kane, a young curate whose people hailed from beneath Croagh Patrick, Ireland&#x2019;s holiest mountain.</p><p>There followed a long silence in the stuffy box of curtain and screen.</p><p>"What compelled you to do such a thing?"</p><p>"I don&#x2019;t know, Father. To feel the weight, I guess, and how it was inside the bell."</p><p>"Well, son, no harm done. But I wouldn&#x2019;t want you to get caught by Mr. O&#x2019;Hara. He tolls that bell with great reverence, you know."</p><p>I gulped. "Yes, Father."</p><p>"For your penance I only ask you to stay out of the bell tower. Can you promise me that?"</p><p>"I can, Father, yes." And I kept that promise out of respect for my earthly as well as my heavenly father.</p><p>On the present night, beneath this crescent moon, the evening Angelus peals automatically on some electronic circuit. As the last notes of the carillon echo over Nobility Hill, no janitor in metal-clasped boots is making his way toward the old house. No Mrs. Durette calls down to watch "the cowboys." No brick school house, with its silent swish of nuns, remains. The moon speaks no folk wisdom of old, though it whispers of the past.</p><p>I remember, as I walk to my current home&#x2014;still within earshot of the bell&#x2014;how one Christmas night as a young boy I stirred in my sleep at the pealing of the bell, and rose to the window to watch my father trek across the churchyard, a humble figure heralding the birth of the Christ Child, but to my eyes like a rose-robed seraph trumpeting on that long-ago Bethlehem night.</p><p>Yes, I can picture the old man still, just as he was. How his mighty hands would clasp the bell rope, his chin anchored firmly to chest, the smooth repetition of pull and hold, his blue watery eyes intent but half closed, and his mumbling the Hail Mary in Irish, a quiet prayer for all the world to hear.</p><p>The Skippy Jar</p><p>MY YOUNGER BROTHER DERMOT and I&#x2014;all of six years old in 1955&#x2014;watched Mom drop a single dime into a large empty Skippy peanut butter jar.</p><p>"What ya doing?" I asked her.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m saving our dimes for Ireland. &#x2019;Twill take awhile, God knows, but it&#x2019;s a start."</p><p>She sighed as I peered into her glass container, her lone silver Mercury dime laying flat on its bottom.</p><p>"Can I go?"</p><p>"You can both go, ...</p></p><h2>Avenger (Blades of the Moonsea): Bk. 3</h2><p>Geran violates his exile to stalk the streets of his former home, hunting down the one who hurt his family and rallying the oppressed people of Hulburg, but he must be wary of his enemies, each and every one of them determined to see him dead.

With&nbsp;a foreword by John Updike.</p><p>These letters are, of course, beautifully written but above all personal, precise, and honest. They evoke E.B. White&#x2019;s life in New York and in Maine at every stage of his life. They are full of memorable characters: White&#x2019;s family, the New Yorker staff and contributors, literary types and show business people, farmers from Maine and sophisticates from New York-Katherine S. White, Harold Ross, James Thurber, Alexander Woolcott, Groucho Marx, John Updike, and many, many more.</p><p>Each decade has its own look and taste and feel. Places, too-from Belgrade (Maine) to Turtle Bay (NYC) to the S.S. Buford, Alaska-bound in 1923-are brought to life in White&#x2019;s descriptions. There is no other book of letters to compare with this; it is a book to treasure and savor at one&#x2019;s leisure.</p><p>As White wrote in this book, &#x201c;A man who publishes his letters becomes nudist&#x2014;nothing shields him from the world&#x2019;s gaze except his bare skin....a man who has written a letter is stuck with it for all time.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>E. B. White, the author of such beloved classics as <em>Charlotte's Web</em>, <em>Stuart Little</em>, and <em>The Trumpet of the Swan</em>, was born in Mount Vernon, New York. He graduated from Cornell University in 1921 and, five or six years later, joined the staff of <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine, then in its infancy. He died on October 1, 1985, and was survived by his son and three grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. White's essays have appeared in <em>Harper's</em> magazine, and some of his other books are: <em>One Man's Meat</em>, <em>The Second Tree from the Corner</em>, <em>Letters of E. B. White</em>, <em>Essays of E. B. White</em>, and <em>Poems and Sketches of E. B. White</em>. He won countless awards, including the 1971 National Medal for Literature and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, which commended him for making a "substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children."</p><p>During his lifetime, many young readers asked Mr. White if his stories were true. In a letter written to be sent to his fans, he answered, "No, they are imaginary tales . . . But real life is only one kind of life&#x2014;there is also the life of the imagination."</p>Language lovers everywhere can be grateful for the reappearance of Letters of E.B. White (HarperCollins, $35), originally collected and edited by Dorothy Lobrano Guth and published in 1976, and now updated by his granddaughter Martha White to include newly released letters from the last decade of his life. A prose stylist with the word version of perfect pitch, White was the unassuming but masterly New Yorker writer, Maine farmer and author of the beloved classics Stuart Little and Charlotte's Web. In many ways, he was a man of few words who always found the right ones. <p>From the first (dated 1908 -- he was born in 1899) to the last (in 1985, the year he died), these letters are a window onto White's world. He described himself once as "a fellow who spends most of his time crouched over a typewriter." As John Updike's affectionate foreword concludes: "His letters give us . . . what a novel scarcely can: the dailiness of a life, its wearing parade of duties and decencies, its endless-seeming fending (though it does end), its accumulating pyramid of, amid errands, carelessly and alertly noted hours, and the frequent if rarely stated discriminations whereby an artist picks his path." </p><p>White once told his brother Stanley, "I avoid writing letters -- it resembles too closely writing itself, and gives me a headache." We're all the richer for his having not been true to his words. </p><p>Dip in anywhere and come up with sentences that are simple and funny and wise:</p><p> "So far, nobody has managed to entice me in front of a television camera with my mouth open and my foot in it. And that's the way I plan to keep it." (January 1978, declining a request for an interview from CBS News's Andy Rooney)</p><p> "Here's a report from Minneapolis, home of the Twins. A mother of two . . . who works in a bookstore, says the ELEMENTS [of Style] is propped up on the front table with all the other hot paperbacks -- between the Rand McNally Road Atlas and The Joy of Sex -- and is selling faster than either of them. Actually, it's scary to learn that the country is turning from sex to semicolons. Makes me uneasy." (July 20, 1979)</p><p> "Quite simply, the best in-depth study ever made of an out-of-his-depth man." (May 28, 1983, suggesting to his biographer a blurb for the dust jacket)</p><p> "Thanks for calling me 'Professor E.B. White.' It has a nice sound but can be shortened to 'E.B. White' -- a saving of one word and a long step toward accuracy." (Dec. 27, 1983) </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.</p></p><h2>Perilous Question: Reform or Revolution? Britain on the Brink, 1832</h2><p>Antonia Fraser's <i>Perilous Question</i> is a dazzling re-creation of the tempestuous two-year period in Britain's history leading up to the passing of the Great Reform Bill in 1832, a narrative which at times reads like a political thriller.<br><br>The era, beginning with the accession of William IV, is evoked in the novels of Trollope and Thackeray, and described by the young Charles Dickens as a cub reporter. It is lit with notable characters. The reforming heroes are the Whig aristocrats led by Lord Grey, members of the richest and most landed cabinet in history yet determined to bring liberty, which would whittle away their own power, to the country. The all-too-conservative opposition was headed by the Duke of Wellington, supported by the intransigent Queen Adelaide, with hereditary memories of the French Revolution. Finally, there were revolutionaries, like William Cobbett, the author of Rural Rides, the radical tailor Francis Place, and Thomas Attwood of Birmingham, the charismatic orator. The contest often grew violent. There were urban riots put down by soldiers and agricultural riots led by the mythical Captain Swing. <br><br>The underlying grievance was the fate of the many disfranchised people. They were ignored by a medieval system of electoral representation that gave, for example, no votes to those who lived in the new industrial cities of Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham, while allocating two parliamentary representatives to a village long since fallen into the sea and, most notoriously, Old Sarum, a green mound in a field. Lord John Russell, a Whig minister, said long afterwards that it was the only period when he genuinely felt popular revolution threatened the country. The Duke of Wellington declared intractably in November 1830 that The beginning of reform is the beginning of revolution.&#x201d; So it seemed that disaster must fall on the British Parliament, or the monarchy, or both.<br><br>The question was: Could a rotten system reform itself in time? On June 7, 1832, the date of the extremely reluctant royal assent by William IV to the Great Reform Bill, it did. These events led to a total change in the way Britain was governed, and set the stage for its growth as the world's most successful industrial power; admired, among other things, for its traditions of good governance a two-year revolution that Antonia Fraser brings to vivid dramatic life.<br></p><p><b>Antonia Fraser</b> has written several historical biographies which have been international bestsellers, since <i>Mary, Queen of Scots</i> published in 1969. These include <i>Marie Antoinette</i>, <i>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</i>, and <i>Cromwell</i>. Other historical works include <i>The Weaker Vessel: Woman's Lot in Seventeenth Century England</i>, and <i>Faith and Treason: the Gunpowder Plot</i>. Antonia Fraser was president of English Pen, the world-wide writers' organization for free speech, and is now a vice-president. She has received many prizes, including the Wolfson History Award, the Norton Medlicott Historical Association Medal, the Franco-British Literary Prize, and the St. Louis Literary Award. She was made a D.B.E (Dame) in 2011 for services to literature. She was married to the Nobel Laureate, Harold Pinter, who died in 2008.<b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br> In Fraser's latest work on British history, she deviates from biography (<i>Mary, Queen of Scots</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</i>) to tackle the perilous question&#x201d; of the Great Reform Bill of 1832, seeking to get at the personalities involved in this historical moment and the reactions of people at the time Fraser moves the narrative along at a quick pace in order to give, as she says, a flavour of the times&#x201d; The book is recommended for Fraser's fans and for British history enthusiasts.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Wharf (UK)</i></b><br> Antonia Fraser captures the febrile times with a kaleidoscope characters who leap off the page in their eminence, silliness and eloquence. This is a particular slice of history demanding a particular reader but it is edifying and breathless stuff and there are many lessons that our current ruling class could learn if they could tear themselves away from their expenses chits to make the effort.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The New Yorker</i></b><br> Fraser writes energetically about the political wrangling, finding both humor and humanity in the struggle.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Total Politics (UK)</i></b><br>"Perilous Question is a cracking good read and should be on every parliamentarian's summer reading list."<br><br><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> Engaging, elaborate and elegantly wrought.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Evening Standard</i></b><br> A spirited attempt to bring the controversy and passion of the era to a new audience. Her prose is charming and fluent. She shows she has lost none of the touch that brought her fame as a popular historian.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Telegraph</i></b><br> Antonia Fraser's superb narrative of the passing of the Bill, which, as well as providing incisive pen portraits of all the major protagonists, is expressive and elegiac of an age when, despite everything, enlightened rationality informed political discourse The 1820s and early 1830s have all too often been seen as a historical backwater between the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the start of the Victorian era that began with the queen's accession in 1837. With Fraser's erudite and acute portrait of this age of reform, it won't be thought so anymore.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Shelf Awareness for Readers</i></b><br> Political gerrymandering as historical thriller: Who would have guessed? In&nbsp;<i>Perilous Question</i>, Antonia Fraser makes precisely that leap--presenting the history behind Britain's Great Reform Act of 1832 in terms that are both historically thorough and deeply fascinating .With her usual perception and clarity, Fraser draws life from a seemingly dry topic, turning political history into real story.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Spectator</i></b><br> The final chapters of the book read like a thriller The book should be required reading for today's millionaire ministers who seem sadly lily-livered by contrast with Grey and his Whigs. This is history as it should be written: lively, witty and, above all, a cracking good read. I found it almost impossible to put down.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Express&nbsp;(UK)</i></b><br>"Do children at school still learn about the Great Reform Bill of 1832? . What I don't recall from school is how thoroughly entertaining it was. What a slice of human drama, how tense, how crucial and how very nearly it could have foundered, thereby propelling our nation into riot and revolution. For that we need impeccable historian Antonia Fraser, who invests such humanity in her huge cast of characters.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Thousand Years over a Hot Stove: A History of American Women Told Through Food, Recipes, and Remembrances</h2><p>Starting with personal reminiscences, this unusual history traces women&#39;s roles relating to cooking from prehistory to the age of the new vegetarian diet and Julia Child. Schenone, a New Jersey-based freelance writer and journalist, includes vintage illustrations, recipes (some of which helped win the West and war), a multidisciplinary bibliography, and resources. Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p><b>Laura Schenone</b> is a freelance writer living with her husband and two children in Montclair, New Jersey. This is her first book.As the title implies, in her first book, freelance writer Schenone has attempted to cover more than a millennium in women's history, tossing in historically interesting recipes along the way. The results of this ambitious project, however, can't help but be broad, and the book is full of sweeping statements such as, "As cooks, Native American women lay the first claim to some of the greatest ingredients in the history of the world." A turgid introduction reaches even further back than 1,000 years to conjure a figure Schenone names "All Woman," whom she imagines as the first female on earth and imbues with all kinds of knowledge and curiosity. Later chapters are more fact-based and reliable. Indeed, when Schenone delves into the specific, her writing immediately improves. For example, a section in a chapter on the 19th century that details the development of urban peddlers and more specifically "hot corn women," is rich with description, evocative and offers information that is probably new to most readers. The author also does a commendable job of drawing the often-ignored connections among politics, women and food when describing events such as the 1917 food riots in New York City and lunch counter sit-ins in the 1960s. The book is chockablock with recipes (often for oddities such as Apple Crisp Pronto from 1943, a concoction of packaged bread, margarine, honey and apples meant to help Rosie the Riveter get dinner on the table), period illustrations and sidebars, including one on Sara Josepha Hale, who standardized the Thanksgiving holiday. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Claimed by the Highlander (The Highlander Series, 2)</h2><p><p>With his tawny mane, battle-hewn brawn, and ferocious roar, Angus "The Lion" MacDonald is the most fearsome warrior Lady Gwendolen has ever seen&#x2015;and she is his most glorious conquest.

Ryle was born at Macclesfield, and was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was Craven Scholar in 1836. After holding a curacy at Exbury in Hampshire, he became rector of St Thomas's, Winchester (1843), rector of Helmingham, Suffolk (1844), vicar of Stradbroke (1861), honorary canon of Norwich (1872), and dean of Salisbury (1880). However before taking the latter office, he was advanced to the new see of Liverpool, where he remained until his resignation, which took place three months before his death at Lowestoft. His appointment to Liverpool was at the recommendation of the outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Ryle was a strong supporter of the evangelical school and a critic of Ritualism. He was a writer, pastor and an evangelical preacher. Among his longer works are Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century (1869), Expository Thoughts on the Gospels (7 vols, 1856&#x2013;69), Principles for Churchmen (1884). Ryle was an athlete who rowed and played Cricket for Oxford, where he took a first class degree in Greats and was offered a college fellowship (teaching position) which he declined. The son of a wealthy banker, he was destined for a career in politics before choosing a path of ordained ministry. While hearing Ephesians 2 read in church in 1838, he felt a spiritual awakening and was ordained by Bishop Sumner at Winchester in 1842. For 38 years he was a parish vicar, first at Helmingham and later at Stradbrooke, in Suffolk. He became a leader of the evangelical party in the Church of England and was noted for his doctrinal essays and polemical writings. In 1880, at age 64, he became the first bishop of Liverpool, at the recommendation of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. He retired in 1900 at age 83 and died later the same year. He is buried in the All Saints' Church, Childwall, Liverpool. In his diocese, he formed a clergy pension fund for his diocese and built over forty churches. Controversially, he emphasized raising clergy salaries ahead of building a cathedral for his new diocese. Ryle was described as having a commanding presence and vigorous in advocating his principles albeit with a warm disposition. He was also credited with having success in evangelizing the blue collar community.</p><h2>A History of European Socialism</h2><p>"This is a serious and accomplished synthesis. . . .

In the eighteenth century, this palace was a world of skulduggery, intrigue, politicking, etiquette, wigs, and beauty spots, where fans whistled open like switchblades and unusual people were kept as curiosities. Lucy Worsley's <i>The Courtiers </i>charts the trajectory of the fantastically quarrelsome Hanovers and the last great gasp of British court life. Structured around the paintings of courtiers and servants that line the walls of the King's Staircase of Kensington Palace-paintings you can see at the palace today-<i>The Courtiers </i>goes behind closed doors to meet a pushy young painter, a maid of honor with a secret marriage, a vice chamberlain with many vices, a bedchamber woman with a violent husband, two aging royal mistresses, and many more. The result is an indelible portrait of court life leading up to the famous reign of George III , and a feast for both Anglophiles and lovers of history and royalty.</p><p><b>Lucy Worsley </b>is, by day, Chief Curator at Historic Royal Palaces, the independent charity that looks after The Tower of London, Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace State Apartments, the Banqueting House in Whitehall, and Kew Palace in Kew Gardens. By night, she is a writer and presenter, most recently author of Cavalier: a Tale of Passion, Chivalry and Great Houses, described by the Mail on Sunday as 'a remarkable achievement by an immensely talented and innovative historian.'<p>&#x201c;All those flowers placed outside Princess Diana's London home 13 summers ago are only the latest chapter in the history of one of those palaces where the walls could tell many a tale about the intersection of aristocracy and political culture.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Martin Rubin, The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Brilliantly entertaining ... [she] writes with flair, bringing her characters to life ... In spite of its accessible charm, <i>Courtiers </i>is a serious historical study which chisels much richness from the ornate, dingy, contradictory world of the palace.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>&#x201c;As chief curator of the Historic Royal Palaces charity Worsley couldn't have been in a better position to winkle out the secrets of one of the palaces under her aegis. She has written a book that vividly brings to life the reigns of the first Hanoverian monarchs and almost humanises the two Georges ... Worsley's book is full of extraordinary characters ... one of the most appealing characters is Caroline of Ansbach, queen to George II, a woman who would rather have been a philosopher than a ruler, ill-treated yet loved by her husband. Her agonising end, brilliantly described, brought me to tears ... a compelling book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Express</i></p><p>&#x201c;We have a fine modern historian to guide us through the dreamlike maze of 18th-century palace life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Racy, amusing and informative. She brings the Georgian courts and their personalities to life ... extremely enjoyable.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Literary Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Threaded through with the stinging witticisms of 18th-century observers, Worsley's own prose bounces along.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Sunday Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Now the definitive work on the early Hanoverian court ... The depth of Worsley's scholarship is demonstrated by the absence of fudged details. She clarifies points of etiquette and toilette, for example, that most historians of the 18th century only half understand ... As in her previous book, Cavalier, Worsley's style is wonderfully readable and her talent for empathy enormous. She always takes a charitable view of superficially obnoxious people and sees half-invisible female figures very clearly ... haunts one's imagination.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Sunday Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;An intimate account of life at court that at times reads like an 18th-century version of Heat magazine ... an exhilarating but unstable world, described with the relish of a court insider.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Waterstones Books Quarterly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Worsley's book romps along breezily [and] the stories are fresh.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Mail on Sunday</i></p><p>&#x201c;The kind of captivating history I most enjoy: full of unexpected stories. It makes one look at Kensington Palace in an entirely new light.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lady Antonia Fraser</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lucy Worsley writes with flair and passion about a lost world where smiles could kill and kisses condemn.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Amanda Foreman</i></p><p>&#x201c;Compulsively readable ... it is impossible not to want to know how they all end up.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Irish Examiner</i></p><p>&#x201c;Worsley is Chief Curator for the Historic Royal Palaces and what she doesn't know about Kensington Palace isn't worth reading, and here she tells its lurid and enthralling story with all the flair, panache and vitality of a born raconteur.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lancashire Evening Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;The colourful goings-on at London's Kensington Palace during its heyday in 1714-60 are vividly described by Dr Lucy Worsley ... the book is packed with extraordinary characters ... most people know little about Georges I and II but Worsley fills that gap.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Leicester Mercury</i></p><p>&#x201c;Brings to life the story of Kensington Palace as it was in the eighteenth century, with tales of sexual intrigue and bad behaviour conducted in the glittering drawing rooms and secret passages of this rabbit-warren of a place, where position and rank counted above everything, including personal happiness.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Angel Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;Engaging and witty, yet also rigorous in its scholarship, <i>Courtiers</i> tells the scandalous stories of Kensington Palace in its Georgian hey-day.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrew Roberts</i></p></p><h2>Why Believe?

She is a coauthor of the bestselling <i>The Mythic Tarot</i> (on which this book is based) and the author of <i>Understanding the Tarot</i> and <i>Mastering the Tarot.</i><p> Introduction </p><p> This Workbook is intended to help Tarot students to deepen and widen their knowledge of the cards. I have had the good fortune to teach many Beginners' Workshops in Tarot which often ended with the cry: 'Now that we know what the cards <i>mean</i> how do we <i>work</i> with them?' In answer to that cry I set up Advanced Workshops. This Workbook is intended to act as a substitute for work shops. It is a sequel to <i>The Mythic Tarot,</i> which provided background history for all forms of Tarot cards, and outlined the basic meanings in a mythological, psychological and divinatory sense. </p><p> Although the Workbook is designed with <i>The Mythic Tarot</i> cards in mind, it can be used equally well with any other Tarot deck with which readers may be more familiar. The mythic pictorial imagery differs from many traditional Tarot decks but the divinatory meanings of the cards remain the same. The exercises are therefore appropriate for use with any Tarot deck. The Workbook aims to help students to structure and increase their knowledge in using the Tarot more effectively in practice. So it concentrates on the two aspects essential to all effective Tarot readings: that readers come to know themselves better via the Tarot, and that they in turn use their knowledge to help interpreting it for other people. </p><p> The Workbook comprises four parts. The first deals with the Major Arcana and concentrates on developing a richer and deeper relationship with the mysterious twenty-two Major Trumps. Guided fantasy and therapeutic colouring exercises are demonstrated in order to enable you to establish a closer relationship with the images. Particular attention is paid to the cards' uses and their value in the search for self-awareness. The second section focuses on the Court Cards and their correlation with Astrology, in particular with zodiacal sun signs through the Knight, Queen and King. The third section offers a closer understanding of the everyday meanings of the Minor Arcana, and space is provided for exercises to help fix their message clearly in the reader's understanding. The fourth section looks at various aspects of Tarot reading, layouts and use of the Tarot therapeutically; whether professionally, for friends, or for personal self-improvement. </p><p> It is important to remember that your proficiency in Tarot readings will be directly linked with the amount of effort put into study. For this reason I have devised various exercises to help you to develop a greater understanding of interpretation. Methodical performance of these exercises will produce a deeper appreciation of the breadth and depth of this fascinating subject. The exercises are structured and set out in a form that encourages you to fill in the blanks and note pages. Keeping a conscientious record of your work over weeks, months and years will develop a continuity in study, as well as charting your progress. In attempting the colouring exercises it is a good idea to record the date and your mood at the time, so that in weeks or months ahead you can look back over your notes and see how your views have changed and developed. Similarly, keeping a record of the readings you perform on the blanks provided, will act as a reminder of the outcome of your own interpretations and those made for friends or clients. I recommend that you open a file to contain photocopies of the blank spreads to facilitate this. </p><p> The style and manner of your approach to reading Tarot will naturally be unique to you. Within the generally accepted principles and symbolism of Tarot, a spread of cards is capable of interpretation in many ways, depending upon one's personal experience. I can offer an insight into my own approach to interpretation, but it will not necessarily be the same as your own. Tarot reading is a deeply personal act which can only develop with time and effort and practice.</p></p><h2>Daily Strengths for Daily Needs: A Collection of Motivational Quotes and Images</h2><p>The perfect gift for any celebration, this pocket volume is full of beautiful images paired with insightful and motivational quotes and sayings.

Why is democracy so important today? Why should it hold such sway over the political speech of the modern world? In <i>Democracy: A History</i> , John Dunn &#x2013; England's leading political theorist &#x2014; sets out to explain the extraordinary presence of democracy in today's world. The story begins in Greece, where it began as an improvised remedy for a very local difficulty twenty&#x2013;five hundred years ago. Athens gave democracy a name (demokratia) and worked out an elaborate, highly distinctive, and astonishingly thorough interpretation of the political conditions required to achieve it. However, democracy's tenure was short&#x2013;lived, flourishing briefly and then fading away almost everywhere for nearly two thousand years. Democracy then suddenly reappeared with the founding of the new American republic and amid the struggles of France's Revolution. The word democrat suddenly became a partisan label and a badge of political honor, lending credibility to the idea of transforming human collective life, anywhere and everywhere, to fit the requirements of democracy that are so familiar to us today.<br></p><p>A Fellow of King&#39;s College, John Dunn is professor of political theory at Cambridge University.All schoolchildren learn that ancient Athens was the birthplace of democracy, forebear of the philosophy of governance that Westerners now almost universally consider the natural right of every human being. But what does our system of protected freedoms, popular elections and checks and balances really share with the public congresses of Kleisthenes and Pericles? In this complement to his previous book, <i>Democracy: The Unfinished Journey</i> (1992), British political theorist Dunn traces the roots of democratic rule, examining the motivations and tactics of its major proponents and detractors while deftly leading his readers through thousands of years of political rhetoric. As much a linguistic and sociological exploration as it is a political history, Dunn's book questions why this word, <i>democracy</i>, has gone from a peculiar concept widely regarded as a failure to a term of ridicule and derision, then to its current status in all languages as an aspirational ideal. Dunn departs ancient Greece for the enlightened radicalism of the American Revolution and the jubilant chaos of the French Revolution in his quest to answer what exactly has given "this very old and much reviled word the stamina and drive to win through in the end." <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's daybreak at Butternut Hollow Pond. It looks peaceful, but there is much going on. Bluegills dart out to feed on insects; a dragonfly snaps up mosquitoes, and then is snapped up himself by a tree swallow. At midmorning, five mallard ducklings narrowly escape the powerful jaws of a snapping turtle; a woodchuck also has luck on his side, when he scampers into his burrow just ahead of a marsh hawk. Sunset finds a largemouth bass on the end of a hook as a young boy reels him in from his canoe. Nighttime is the busiest of all; bats and nighthawks feast on bugs, crayfish search for night crawlers, and raccoons look for crayfish. Two concepts are beautifully demonstrated in this picture book for older readers: the hunter invariably becomes the hunted, and all living things are players in a complex cycle of interdependence that is much more than a simple food chain. Heinz fills this nature drama with action and sensory-loaded language that pulls children in as no science textbook can, and Marstall's realistic watercolor illustrations offer a lovely window to observe the diverse ecosystem. An excellent resource for the science curriculum. <i>Lauren Peterson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This time out she introduces her class to the insect kingdom via an excursion through a honeybee hive. Garbed in bee costumes complete with antennae, and sprayed with the proper pheromones, the students are accepted by the workers and allowed to perform such chores as foraging for nectar and pollen, building honeycombs, making honey, and feeding larvae. They also have the opportunity to observe typical honeybee behavior. The field trip ends with a bit of drama when a bear tries to raid the hive. A plethora of pseudo school reports provide additional information on the topic. Degen's colorful and amusing cartoons heighten the adventures. Clearly written and well organized, this new title presents accurate scientific information leavened with a touch of humor that is never condescending. The character of the magical Ms. Frizzle is as well developed and intriguing as ever.

It lacks the close-up color photography provided in Heiderose and Andreas Fischer-Nagel's excellent Life of the Honeybee (Carolrhoda, 1986) but it provides much the same general information and will be a good companion volume.

The beautiful young woman died from tuberculosis in 1931. With her parents&#39; permission von Cosel had an above ground mausoleum built for her. He visited the tomb every night and by 1933 he had taken the body home. In writing this definitive and mesmerizing tale of the most obsessive love imaginable, Ben Harrison did his homework thoroughly, studying numerous press accounts from the 1930s as well as the von Cosel memoir. What makes Undying Love so special are the interviews Ben conducted with those old enough to have known the story participants and the way things were in Key West during the 1930s. One of his better discoveries was a song, La Boda Negra, The Black Wedding, which Count von Cosel claimed Elena sang to him from the elaborate crypt he had built for her in the Catholic section of the Key West cemetery. The lyric made it unmistakeably clear. She wanted to come home with him. Above the coffin of Elena Hoyos, a black crucifix inexplicably glowed with a soft light as Count Carl von Cosel extracted the inner casket from the outer one. With difficulty because the caskets were heavy, he pushed, shoved, pulled and maneuvered the inner one onto the grass outside the tomb, closed and locked the tomb door. Their remarkable journey was about to begin... The book also includes eight pages of compelling, unforgettable photos.</p><p>Ben Harrison is a well-known Key West playwright, singer and songwriter.

At the home of Red's Granny, Jake finds a brown beast sprawled under a purple duvet, but does not jump to conclusions: "I decided to take our little party downtown to clear things up." The resolute but dim investigator who appears in black-and-white while all around him is in color inspects this "Granny's" pointy ears and bulging, hard-boiled-egg eyes; later he learns the real Granny is on vacation. Meanwhile, the pot-bellied wolf never resists arrest. With its lockjaw grin and unfocused stare, the silent perp appears more neurotic than predatory, and Red seems quite unruffled by the situation. First-time author artist McClements mimes the punchy first-person style of detective fiction and presents the evidence as snapshots paperclipped to a yellow manila folder. Visual jokes a diagram of Humpty Dumpty's fall, a filing cabinet labeled "Frogs (non-princely)" provide mild levity in the collage illustrations. But unlike the sustained Mother Goose send-up in last year's The Web Files, this book is an open-and-shut case. Ages 3-7.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Grade 1-3-Jake is called in by Red R. Hood to determine if her grandmother has been replaced by an impostor. Arriving at the scene, it is clear that something is amiss and as the clues mount, the Storyville cop builds his case and ultimately gets his man-Harry A. Wolf (aka Big Bad). While the text is chock-full of witticisms, it is a bit sophisticated, e.g., "They were as sharp as an aged piece of cheddar." "In an ironic twist of fate, he is now working in the Hood division of the Storyville Prison." Fortunately, McClements's creative collages of images, words, and pictures save the book from obscurity. Comical depictions of the villain show large yellow jaws accompanied by a slouching oversized body. The town of Storyville is a mishmash of real-world objects and cartoon scenery. Puzzles abound as each picture poses a pun or story-related clue to figure out. Littered throughout the landscape are references to popular fairy tales, from boxes containing puppy-dog tails and magic beans to pictures of a house made out of a boot and a portrait of a goose with a golden egg.

In this eagerly awaited second installment, Suzuki, now 70, reflects on his entire life and on his hopes for the future. The book begins with his life-changing encounters with racism while interned in a Canadian concentration camp during World War II and continues through his troubled teenage years and later successes as a scientist and host of PBS's <i>The Nature of Things.</i> With characteristic candor and passion, he describes his growing consciousness of the natural world and humankind&#x2019;s precarious place in it; his travels throughout the world and his meetings with international leaders, from Nelson Mandela to the Dalai Lama; and the abiding role of nature and family in his life. <i>David Suzuki</i> is an intimate and inspiring look at one of the most uncompromising people on the planet.</p><p><p><strong>David Suzuki</strong> is an internationally renowned geneticist and environmentalist and a recipient of UNESCO&#x2019;s Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science and the 2009 Right Livelihood Award.

The notorious Captain Kidd was rumored to have left part of his treasure somewhere along here, and as McGinnis and two friends started to dig, they found what turned out to be an elaborately engineered shaft constructed of oak logs, nonindigenous coconut mats, and landfill that came to be known as the Money Pit.<br>Ever since that summer day in 1795, the possibility of what might be hidden in the depths of a small island off the south coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, has made it the site of the world's longest, most expensive, and most perplexing treasure hunt. Author D'Arcy O'Connor recounts the fascinating stories and amazing discoveries of past and current treasure seekers who have sought Oak Island's fabled treasure for over two hundred years. It has baffled scientists and madmen, scholars and idiots, millionaires and get-rich-quick schemers, psychics, engineers, charlatans, and even a former president of the United States. The island has consumed the fortunes-and in some cases, the lives-of those who have obsessively set out to unlock its secret. Despite all their efforts, the mystery remains unsolved, and not a single dime of treasure has ever been recovered.<br>The present-day search is an archaeological dig exceeding anything ever done anywhere for similar purposes, and it may well result in the discovery of one of the world's richest and most historically significant treasures. But this is also the story of individuals who have dedicated years of their lives to discover what was buried long ago beneath this strange island. They are driven by a lust for gold, by archaeological curiosity, and by their determination to outwit the engineer who was responsible for the Oak Island enigma.<br></p><p>D'Arcy O'Connor, a former feature writer for The Wall Street Journal, is a round-the-world sailor and a continuing freelancer and documentary film-maker.

In Norway the book has been a huge bestseller, and rights have already been sold into sixteen countries.

Back then, Tommy was separated from his sisters after he stood up to their abusive father. Jim was by Tommy's side through it all. But one winter night, a chance event on a frozen lake forever changed the balance of their friendship. Now Jim fishes alone on a bridge as Tommy drives by in a new Mercedes, and it's clear their fortunes have reversed.

Armstrong was bleeding from both ears, addled by a concussion, and deafened by the shell that had just ripped a jagged eight-inch hole through the center of his Sherman tank, missing Armstrong by a foot or two at best.</p><p>The M4A1 Sherman was one of three tanks that had moved out ahead of infantry units of the First Marine Division this morning to scout enemy-infested Kunishi Ridge, the last remaining Japanese stronghold near the southern tip of Okinawa. When they'd come under intense artillery fire, the other two tanks managed to beat a hasty retreat, but Armstrong and his crew, grinding along in the lead, weren't so fortunate.</p><p>In the soundless void whirling around him, acting Sergeant Armstrong wondered if he was seriously wounded,maybe dying. Death was a constant companion these days for men of the First Marine Tank Battalion, and the expectation of being killed or maimed at any moment was as much a part of life as breathing. But now death felt especially close and intimate, and, as Armstrong squinted through the tank's smoldering innards at the young second lieutenant sprawled a few feet from him, he understood why.</p><p>The lieutenant, who'd come along on their mission strictly as an observer, was still writhing in agony, but it was obvious that he'd be dead soon. His belly was split wide open, and his intestines spilled out into his lap. His left forearm hung by a thin strand of mangled flesh. This was the lieutenant's first combat mission. It would also be his last.</p><p>The lieutenant's mouth moved, and Armstrong read the plea on his bloody lips without hearing them:</p><p>"Oh God,Mama, help me."</p><p>Armstrong turned to see Corporal Stephen Smith, the tank's driver, crawling toward him. As tank commander, it was Armstrong's responsibility to take charge of the situation.</p><p>He nodded toward the lieutenant. "I hate to move him, but let's try to get him outside," he told Smith, feeling the words vibrate in his throat. "If we take another hit, we're all dead."</p><p>Armstrong watched as the lieutenant pulled out his Ka-Bar knife and severed the thread of tissue that bound his ruined left arm to his body. When the arm fell away, its former owner dropped the knife and looked at Armstrong. "That might make it a little easier," he whispered.</p><p>With Armstrong attempting to hold the lieutenant's exposed organs in place, he and Smith half carried and half dragged him down through the escape hatch in the floor of the tank. Behind them, Private David Spoerke, the designated loader for the 75-millimeter cannon, moved to aid the Sherman's bow gunner and assistant driver, PFC Ben Okum, who was moaning and bleeding from wounds in his arm and leg.</p><p>It took what seemed like an hour for the five of them to make it to a nearby shell crater that was barely far enough away to keep them from being blown up with the disabled tank if it should explode. By the time they laid the lieutenant in the deepest part of the hole, his eyes were glazed and his face was grayish.</p><p>"Give me some morphine, and get out of here," he whispered. "They may open up on us again any second."</p><p>Armstrong's hearing was beginning to come back, and the lieutenant's words were faintly audible. "We can't leave you here like this," Armstrong said. "We'll try to get you a medic."</p><p>"Just go, Jack," the lieutenant said."Don't waste your time."</p><p>Smith broke open one of the needle-equipped morphine packets that each Marine routinely carried and injected the dying man in the neck. Armstrong put some extra packets beside the lieutenant's right hand, and Spoerke tried to tie a belt around the stump of his left arm to slow the bleeding.</p><p>"Get moving," the lieutenant said. "That's an order."</p><p>The lieutenant was a new replacement who'd just joined the battalion as a platoon leader, and he'd been around only for a day or two. Armstrong couldn't even remember his name, but he seemed like a decent enough guy. He was a friendly, easygoing sort who got along well with the tank crews. He was also a helluva lot tougher than he looked.</p><p><i>Any man who can cut off his own arm with a Ka-Bar has to be one gritty SOB, Armstrong thought, even if he's too deep in shock to know what he's doing.</i></p><p>"Aye, sir,"Armstrong said. "We'll send help back as soon as we can."</p><p>In his dazed condition, Armstrong almost forgot that he was under strict orders to destroy the gyrostabilizer unit on the tank's 75-millimeter gun to keep it from falling into enemy hands, so he had to stagger over to the Sherman, drop a grenade into the unit, and scramble back to safety.</p><p>Back at the crater, he took a last look at the lieutenant, who was silent and ashen but still appeared to be breathing. Then he bit his lip and turned to help Smith with the wounded gunner. As they stumbled back along the draw they'd come down a few minutes earlier, a burst of fire from Japanese rifles and automatic weapons kicked up dust inches from their heels. Armstrong took one brief glance over his shoulder at a hillside literally crawling with Japanese, each of them firing at the fleeing tankers. Then he ran for all he was worth, pulling Okum along by his good arm and thinking: <i>Those guys must be the worst shots in the Japanese army! How can all of them possibly be missing us?</i></p><p>This was the third tank that had been blown out from under Armstrong in just over a month -- the first by a volley of armor-piercing shells from a Japanese antitank gun, the second by a land mine. Four or five guys -- both tank crewmen and members of the infantry fire team accompanying the tank -- had been wounded in the blast from the land mine, at least two fatally, and Armstrong had lost a damned good driver to the antitank gun. But this third time seemed worse than the others. The image of the lieutenant lying in the shell hole haunted Armstrong, and he couldn't block it out of his mind.</p><p>Okum was dragging his bad leg behind him, and Armstrong was gasping for breath and wondering how much farther he could run when he spotted a rice paddy dead ahead. He pushed the driver over the bank into the shallow water and jumped in after him. Then both of them slogged desperately through the oozy, reeking mixture of mud and human excrement toward the safety of a rear area a half mile away.<b></b></p><p><b>*</b></p><p>A couple of hours later, his ears still ringing and his head pounding furiously, Armstrong made a distressing discovery: The shell that had doomed his tank hadn't come from enemy artillery. It had been fired from one of the First Marine Division's own 105-millimeter howitzers.</p><p>"We heard that General Buckner himself, commander of the U.S. Tenth Army, was directing the fire,"Armstrong would recall long after the incident. "I understand he apologized to our battalion CO, Colonel Jeb Stuart, but that didn't make us feel a whole lot better."</p><p>His third close brush with death left Armstrong gun-shy. He'd always heard that every near miss brought a guy closer to the "big one." If that was true, the odds were bound to be catching up with him. If the third time was the charm, like they said, what about the fourth? Part of him chafed to get back into action, but he felt a surge of relief on learning that no replacement tank was immediately available. And when a fellow tank commander invited him to ride along on a mission to resupply a frontline rifle company, Jack said, "Thanks, but no thanks."</p><p>Each of Armstrong's three lost tanks had borne the same handpainted nickname -- "Ticket to Tokyo." The name had a brash, bold ring to it that had appealed to all the guys in the original crew. They'd all had a hand in picking it, and they'd gotten a big chuckle the first time they'd seen it.</p><p>In those early days on Okinawa, most of Armstrong's buddies had kiddingly called him "Wheaties," for the breakfast cereal that sponsored a popular radio program called <i>Jack Armstrong, All-American Boy</i>. It had been typical of the wisecracking and bravado that characterized the First Marine Tank Battalion then. Before Okinawa, the Sherman tank had operated with near impunity throughout the Pacific theater, where the "sardine-can" enemy tanks were no match for it in armor or firepower. Not anymore, though.Now the Japanese had antitank weapons that could make a Sherman look like a hunk of Swiss cheese -- and frequently did.</p><p>This was one reason why, in recent weeks, Armstrong's sense of humor had gradually gone dormant. Not many things seemed funny anymore, much less cute or clever. Living with death day after day and seeing your friends killed or crippled could make you old and grim before your time, and many of the guys who'd kidded "Wheaties" Armstrong about his heroic fictional namesake were gone now.His assistant driver and close friend, Corporal Alvin Tenbarge, had been blown apart in the land mine explosion, and Corporal Harlan Stephan, one of the best drivers in the battalion, had -- like the young lieutenant -- lost an arm to an armor-piercing shell. The difference was that Harlan was still alive, the last Armstrong had heard.</p><p>The casualty list grew longer each day, with the end of it nowhere in sight, and as nasty as Okinawa was, it was merely a warm-up, or so everyone believed. Next loomed an invasion of Japan itself, and every man in the First Marine Division who could still fire a weapon would be issued his own one-way ticket there.</p><p><i>We'll have a million casualties, maybe more, the rumor mill needled. Eighty percent of us'll never make it back to the States in one piece. Make a joke out of that if you can.</i></p><p>And yet, if he should be given a fourth tank to command, Armstrong knew it would bear exactly the same name as the first three. Plenty of other names were available -- like "Sweet Mary" for a girl he'd known in Melbourne an eternity or two ago, or "Lone Star" for his native state of Texas, or "Jap Zapper" just for the hell of it. For that matter, there was no law that said a tank couldn't simply remain anonymous.</p><p>The last thing Jack wanted anymore was a ticket to Tokyo -- or any place else in Japan. The only ticket he...</p></p><h2>Abarat Days Of Magic, Nights Of War</h2><p><p>Candy Quackenbush's adventures in the Abarat are getting stranger by the hour.

But instead, her ambitions land her in the clutches of a gang of unsavory pirates led by a devious magician. Her only hope is Natsu, a strange boy she happens to meet on her travels. Natsu&#x2019;s not your typical hero&#x2013;he gets motion sickness, eats like a pig, and his best friend is a talking cat. With friends like this, is Lucy better off with her enemies?</p><p>Hiro Mashima was born May 3, 1977, in Japan&#39;s Nagano prefecture. His series Rave Master has made him one of the most popular manga artists in America. Fairy Tail, currently being serialized in Weekly Shonen Magazine, is his latest creation.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;Lucy is a wizard who's looking to join the Fairy Tail Guild, which is famous for its members' out-of-control antics. When she meets Natsu, she never imagines that he's really Salamander of Fairy Tail. He spends much of his time as an ordinary guy who suffers from severe motion sickness in trains, boats, and even horse-drawn carriages. But when he taps into his magical abilities, he turns into an awesome fighter who uses fire to vanquish his enemies. By the end of the first volume, Lucy has joined the guild as well as Natsu and his flying cat as a team member. In the second volume, the team steals a magical book from the evil Duke Everlue and joins forces with Erza Scarlet to fight a guild that plans to use death-curse magic. Lucy and Natsu are the central figures in a large cast of characters, many of whom have unique abilities. Readers never see Erza's special skills in action, but it's clear that they involve lots of blood. The beings summoned by Lucy from the celestial spirit world are often temperamental and sometimes politically incorrect. The humor is often jaw-droppingly funny, meaning that the characters' jaws drop so low and so often that they look like something out of a Tex Avery cartoon. The illustrations are lively and keep the stories moving briskly. Each volume is filled with magic and humor and ends with a suspenseful cliff-hanger that will draw readers into the rest of the series.<i>&#x2013;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in Oakland, California.Technology has come full circle and is intertwined with and, in some cases, is indistinguishable from magic. This collection of linked short stories is set against the backdrop of an earth that is long past its prime. Four of the stories share a number of the same characters, but all are connected through setting and mood. Arthur Morey is a consistent storyteller who uses pace and timing to good effect. He imparts the awe of the characters in describing the natural beauty of the earth. Further, he has a light touch as he depicts their wistfulness and nostalgia toward the changes taking place as the earth continues to fade.

His research into the origins of human sacrifice involve encounters among the Incas of the high Andes where priests and witches still conduct sacrificial killings combining Christian and ancient pagan rites, both of which are usually accompanied by heavy consumption of alcohol. Described in detail are methods of victim selection, execution and reasons for these acts--which include deification of the victim, propitiation of gods and of natural forces. Tierney's analysis of the complex evolution of attitudes toward human sacrifice from the actual to the symbolic, e.g., from Crucifixion of Christ to Eucharist, is treated summarily as little more than an addendum to his firsthand accounts of his Andean adventures.

America's most serious social tragedy, slavery and its legacy, spread only where cotton could be grown. Both before and after the Civil War, blacks were assigned to the cotton fields while a pervasive racial animosity and fear of a black migratory invasion caused white Northerners to contain blacks in the South. <br><br>Gene Dattel's pioneering study explores the historical roots of these most central social issues. In telling detail Mr. Dattel shows why the vastly underappreciated story of cotton is a key to understanding America's rise to economic power. When cotton production exploded to satiate the nineteenth-century textile industry's enormous appetite, it became the first truly complex global business and thereby a major driving force in U.S. territorial expansion and sectional economic integration. It propelled New York City to commercial preeminence and fostered independent trade between Europe and the United States, providing export capital for the new nation to gain its financial "sea legs" in the world economy. Without slave-produced cotton, the South could never have initiated the Civil War, America's bloodiest conflict at home. <br><br>Mr. Dattel's skillful historical analysis identifies the commercial forces that cotton unleashed and the pervasive nature of racial antipathy it produced. This is a story that has never been told in quite the same way before, related here with the authority of a historian with a profound knowledge of the history of international finance. With 23 black-and-white illustrations.</p><p>Gene Dattel grew up in the cotton country of the Mississippi Delta and studied history at Yale and law at Vanderbilt. He then embarked on a twenty-year career in financial capital markets as a managing director at Salomon Brothers and at Morgan Stanley. A consultant to major financial institutions and to the Pentagon, he established a reputation as a foremost authority on Asian economies. His The Sun That Never Rose remains the definitive work on Japanese financial institutions in the 1980s. Mr. Dattel is now an independent scholar who lectures widely and has served as an adviser to the New York Historical Society and the B. B. King Museum. He lives in New York City. For more information, see www.genedattel.com.Gene Dattel turns economic history into a gripping narrative in this sweeping synthesis of an important but underappreciated chapter in the American past. From Whitney's gin to the mechanical picker, Dattel shows just how close the links have been between King Cotton and the race issue. This book is highly recommended. (Gavin Wright, Stanford University)<br><br>This is a book not just for those who grew up in the cotton fields of Mississippi as I did, but far more than that it is a challenging and compelling account of the complex role which cotton has played in the economic, racial, and political history of our nation. No one is better equipped to present that story than Gene Dattel, a superbly gifted writer, who also happens to possess an encyclopedic knowledge of this fascinating subject. This volume elevates to an important new level our comprehension and appreciation of a largely neglected chapter in our conflicted past. (William F. Winter, former governor of Mississippi)<br><br>Gene Dattel grew up in the Mississippi Delta, historically the center of cotton production in the United States, and a major target of voter registration workers in the 1960s. Thereafter he spent twenty years on Wall Street. These experiences superbly position him to remind us, in overwhelmingly persuasive detail, that for almost a century and a half cotton was America's leading export; and that before, during, and after the Civil War, white America, North as well as South, endeavored to keep an African American labor force &#x2018;contained' in the cotton fields. Thus cotton was the foundation of both the growth of the national economy and of racism in the United States. (Staughton Lynd, author of "Stepping Stones: Memoir of a Life Together")<br><br>This is an engrossing and revealing study. It should be read not just by history buffs but by all Americans who want to understand the events and forces that shaped and left their imprint on our country. The book captures with great style and intensity the overwhelming influence of cotton and slavery on our economy, finances, social behavior, and political life. Cotton and slavery prevented the formation of a more perfect union in 1776 and as the author concludes America no longer needs cotton, but still bears cotton&#x2019;s human legacy. (Henry Kaufman, economist; author of On Money and Markets)<br><br>A very powerful and informative book. . . . Once I started to read it I was hooked. . . . A landmark, combining a firm grasp of finance and its controlling impact on the pattern of rural life in cotton growing regions with human sympathy for both field hands and planters. (William H. McNeill, Professor Emeritus, University of Chicago, and author of The Rise of the West.)<br><br>A fascinating account of an essential aspect of American history. Gene Dattel brings clarity and insight to a subject we've long known about but not known well. A model for integrating economic, social, and political history&#x2015;and a terrific read too. (H. W. Brands, professor of history at the University of Texas and author of The Money Men)<br><br>I am very impressed by the extensiveness of the research, the quality of the writing, and the vigor of the narrative. Gene Dattel has produced an important book that shows how 'King Cotton' could, all too often, be a cruel tyrant. The book will be welcomed by both specialists and the general reader. (John McCardell, professor emeritus of history at Middlebury College)<br><br>Gene Dattel has produced a superb study of King Cotton's reign over the United States of America. Though exceptionally well versed in the economic history of cotton production, he never loses sight of the human suffering caused by slavery and its consequences. He also gives a first-class account of the politics of cotton. From the Constitution to the Civil War to the Civil Rights movement, each of the key events in the history of the United States looks quite different when you understand the (usually malign) role King Cotton played. (Niall Ferguson, Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History and William Ziegler Professor of Business Administration, Harvard)<br><br>Books about American history tend to be either triumphal or highly critical. Gene Dattel&#x2019;s study of the racial legacy of cotton, America&#x2019;s leading export up to World War II, is neither. Above all, it is informed, honest, and balanced. Dattel explains insightfully just how slavery and racial discrimination came to plague our nation&#x2019;s ideals and the promise of American life. Mostly it was a by-product&#x2014;north and south, east and west&#x2014;of trying to earn a buck, of pursuing the Almighty Dollar. His book is a gem&#x2014;one of the finest works on the American national experience to appear in many years. (Richard Sylla, New York University)<br><br>Eugene Dattel's command of the details of American economic and social life is impressive in this sweeping study of the relationship between cotton and its human legacy in the treatment of African Americans. The book is full of sage judgments and fresh insights, eminently fair and unflinching in its critical assessments. He shows the power of finance and the search for profit in shaping American attitudes from the Constitutional Convention to contemporary issues of cotton's decline and the search for social justice for the people who worked the fields of this global crop. Dattel skillfully portrays the spaces of cotton's kingdom, from the Mississippi Delta fields to the board rooms of New York City's financial companies, and offers compelling evidence of the materialism that drove American life around cotton, often compromising the better angels of our nature.

She has published more than 15 books on gardening and nature crafts. Ms. Martin lives in Atlanta, where she writes, quilts, paints, and spends as much time as possible in her garden.</p><p> <i>Introduction</i> </p><p> Since the first edition of this book came out, my passion for hammering flowers has not waned. I continue to be amazed at both the beauty and ease of doing this craft and the stunning results obtained by all who put their hand to it. </p><p> If you have never tried hammering flowers, what a treat you have in store! If you can hammer a nail, you can be an artist. Welcome to the craft of making lasting and beautiful botanical impressions with little more than a hammer, fabric or paper, and plant materials. I'm not aware of any other craft that offers so many creative opportunities and can be done by such a wide variety of people--from preschoolers to graduate art students to the elderly population. This is a craft that is mysterious, yet simple; it is also failproof and, at the same time, challenging. </p><p> The basic technique can be described in just a few words: Simply pick a flower, place it on paper or fabric, cover with a paper towel, and hammer away. The results are astounding--and instant. Many plants transfer perfectly onto material, complete with vibrant colors and tiny details. There is no waiting, no mixing paint, no applying ink. Some plants, such as little Johnny-jump-ups, transfer so perfectly you almost need a magnifying glass to see all the details. Other plants, such as impatiens, come out looking more like an impressionistic painting. </p><p> Although this craft is literally easy enough for a preschooler to do, it also offers variations that will attract and challenge even the most experienced artist. Each plant transfers in a unique way, and even the same kind of plant will transfer with varying results, depending upon how mature the leaves or flowers are, what type of material or paper is used, and whether or not the fabric was pretreated before hammering. All of these factors influence the look of the final plant image. </p><p> Writing this book has been all about trial and error and discovery, for each flower and leaf brought new surprises. Some of the impressions I created went straight into the trash can, but others came out so well that I used them to adorn clothing such as blouses and scarves, to create art suitable for framing or decorating useful items such as tablecloths and tote bags. My "research" led me to try 60 different plants, flowers, and leaves. (See "Plant Guide," pages 154 to 174, for a full listing.) Further experimenting reinforced the usefulness of hammering on the back side of the fabric to enable you to quickly see results and of taping down plant material to keep it from shifting during hammering. One other fun and useful discovery was that you can get similar results by "hammering" with the back of a metal spoon-a great new find for those who work with kids. The result of all this experimenting and discovering is this book--a treasure trove of information for crafters. </p><p> You may wonder why a craft as easy as pounding flowers would warrant a book. My answer is a simple one: While the basic technique is undeniably easy, the variations are so endless they can be overwhelming. Which plants work best? What fabrics and papers work best? How do you make the image long lasting? Can you wash the fabric impressions? You'll find the answers to these questions, and many more, in the pages that follow. </p><p> This book gets you started, offering ideas for plants that give you good impressions, the best materials to impress them on, and instructions for making crafts with the materials you have decorated. Some of these projects take only a few minutes to do, while others are works of art that take months to finish. </p><p> I've filled this book with information on the art of hammering flowers, and my hope is that you will use it as a springboard to stimulate your own creativity. Start here, with my basic techniques and instructions, then venture out and try new flowers, using them in new ways. While it's fun to have and give items made from your hammered art, it is the process of creation that is the true gift of this craft, for it allows everyone, almost without exception, to become an artist. So read through the basic instructions, take a look at some of the projects, then give it a try--you'll never have more fun with a hammer!</p></p><h2>The Last Enemy: The Memoir of a Spitfire Pilot (Classics of War)</h2><p>One of the classic works of World War II.&#x2015;London Review of Books</p><p>Richard Hillary was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1919. He was sent to boarding school in England and went to Trinity College, Oxford in 1937. He was still at Oxford when the Second World War broke out and, with other members of the R.A.F Volunteer Reserve, was immediately called to duty. He blew Spitfires in the Battle of Britain before being shot down and horribly burned. He underwent several operations by the great plastic surgeon, Archibald McIndoe. After a slow and very painful recovery, Hilary begged to be allowed to return to flying. He was killed, at the age of 23, when his plane crashed in a night training operation.&#34;The Last Enemy rapidly acquired the aura of a book that says something vital, whose importance goes beyond what it literally describes&#34; * Sebastian Faulks * &#34;This slim volume of Hillary&#39;s seems to have a weight which makes it sink into the depths of one&#39;s memory, while tons of printed bulk drift as flotsom on its surface&#34; -- Arthur Koestler &#34;One of the classic books of World War Two&#34; -- Philip French * London Review of Books * &#34;Rivetingly well told...It will still speak to anyone who cares for the romance and tragedy of a lost hero.&#34; -- Godfrey Smith * Sunday Times * &#34;Elegantly affecting memoir&#34; -- David Horspool * The Times *</p><h2>25 Surprising Marriages: How Great Christians Struggled to Make Their Marriages Work</h2><p>William Peterson looks closely at the marriages of 25 leaders in modern Christianity, looking for valuable lessons for dealing with such universal issues as financial worries, temptation, separation, and personality differences.</p><p>The marriages of exemplary Christians are not always models of Christian love, as Petersen shows in several of these accounts of the married lives of 25 well-known past and contemporary Christians. For example, John Wesley, father of the Methodist Church, entered an explosive union with Molly Vazeille, who finally left him after 25 years of marriage. Quaker author Hannah Whitall Smith (The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, 1874) ironically endured a marriage made wretched by her husband's instability and infidelity.

Revell and Chosen Books, writes in an engaging style that is humorous yet tempered with compassion.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dominic</h2><p>Bored with life in his neighborhood, a lively mutt sets out on a road to adventure</p><p>Dominic is a one-of-a-kind dog. One day this exuberant, restless, freedom-loving fellow decides there isn't enough going on in his neighborhood to satisfy his need for adventure. And off he goes, with an assortment of hats (rakish, dashing, solemn, and martial), his precious piccolo, and a few other things, leaving a note on his door: <blockquote> Dear Friends, I am leaving rather in a hurry to see more of the world, so I have no time to say goodbye to you individually. I embrace you all and sniff you with love. I don't know when I'll be back. But back I will be. Dominic. </blockquote> On the road, this curious canine is lighthearted, open to every option, all senses aquiver. It's not long before he encounters a prophetic witch-alligator, (who had "many more teeth than necessary for any ordinary dental purpose"); a catfish who gives him a long, sharp spear that will make him invincible in serious combat; and even the infamous Doomsday Gang, "who robbed, ravaged, cheated, attacked innocent creatures at large and travelers especially, and did all sorts of damaging mischief." Dominic remains undaunted throughout, for "challenges were his delight. Whatever life offered was, this way or that, a test of one's skills, one's faculties; and he enjoyed proving equal to these tests." <p> As he continues his journey, we find Dominic to be considerate, compassionate, generous, and philosophical. As he ponders the nature of death, the nature of wealth, the role of art in our lives, the nature of good and evil, and the yearning for true love, readers are left with a feeling that life is basically good, and even splendid: </p><blockquote> "What a wonderful world!" thought Dominic. "How perfect!" Had it been up to him when things were first made, he wouldn't have made them a whit different. Every leaf was in its proper place. Pebbles, stones, flowers, all were just as they ought to be. Water ran where it should run. They sky was properly blue. All sounds were in tune. Everything had its appropriate smell. </blockquote> Kids will adore the magical, comical, action-packed adventures of this remarkable dog, and readers of any age will come away from William Steig's <i>Dominic</i> somehow changed.

Think again.<br><br>Down here everyone arrives with a sack, like the sacks used to keep the winds in, but each of these sacks is full of words &#x2014; words you&#x2019;ve spoken, words you&#x2019;ve heard, words that have been said about you. Some sacks are very small, others large; my own is of a reasonable size, though a lot of the words in it concern my eminent husband. What a fool he made of me, some say. It was a specialty of his: making fools. He got away with everything, which was another of his specialties: getting away.<br><br>He was always so plausible. Many people have believed that his version of events was the true one, give or take a few murders, a few beautiful seduct�resses, a few one-eyed monsters. Even I believed him, from time to time. I knew he was tricky and a liar, I just didn&#x2019;t think he would play his tricks and try out his lies on me. Hadn&#x2019;t I been faithful? Hadn&#x2019;t I waited, and waited, and waited, despite the temptation &#x2014; almost the compulsion &#x2014; to do otherwise? And what did I amount to, once the official version gained ground? An edifying legend. A stick used to beat other women with. Why couldn&#x2019;t they be as considerate, as trustworthy, as all-suffering as I had been? That was the line they took, the singers, the yarn-spinners. Don&#x2019;t follow my example, I want to scream in your ears &#x2014; yes, yours! But when I try to scream, I sound like an owl.<br><br>Of course I had inklings, about his slipperiness, his wiliness, his foxiness, his &#x2014; how can I put this? &#x2014; his unscrupulousness, but I turned a blind eye. I kept my mouth shut; or, if I opened it, I sang his praises. I didn&#x2019;t contradict, I didn&#x2019;t ask awkward questions, I didn&#x2019;t dig deep. I wanted happy endings in those days, and happy endings are best achieved by keeping the right doors locked and going to sleep during the rampages.<br><br>But after the main events were over and things had become less legendary, I realized how many people were laughing at me behind my back &#x2014; how they were jeering, making jokes about me, jokes both clean and dirty; how they were turning me into a story, or into several stories, though not the kind of stories I&#x2019;d prefer to hear about myself. What can a woman do when scandalous gossip travels the world? If she defends herself she sounds guilty. So I waited some more.<br><br>Now that all the others have run out of air, it&#x2019;s my turn to do a little story-making. I owe it to myself. I&#x2019;ve had to work myself up to it: it&#x2019;s a low art, tale-telling. Old women go in for it, strolling beggars, blind singers, maidservants, children &#x2014; folks with time on their hands. Once, people would have laughed if I&#x2019;d tried to play the minstrel &#x2014; there&#x2019;s nothing more preposterous than an aristocrat fumbling around with the arts &#x2014; but who cares about public opinion now? The opinion of the people down here: the opinion of shadows, of echoes. So I&#x2019;ll spin a thread of my own.<br><br>The difficulty is that I have no mouth through which I can speak. I can&#x2019;t make myself understood, not in your world, the world of bodies, of tongues and fingers; and most of the time I have no listeners, not on your side of the river. Those of you who may catch the odd whisper, the odd squeak, so easily mistake my words for breezes rustling the dry reeds, for bats at twilight, for bad dreams.<br><br>But I&#x2019;ve always been of a determined nature. Patient, they used to call me. I like to see a thing through to the end.<br><br><b>ii</b><br>The Chorus Line:<br>A Rope-Jumping Rhyme<br>we are the maids<br>the ones you killed<br>the ones you failed<br><br>we danced in air<br>our bare feet twitched<br>it was not fair<br><br>with every goddess, queen, and bitch<br>from there to here<br>you scratched your itch<br><br>we did much less<br>than what you did<br>you judged us bad<br><br>you had the spear<br>you had the word<br>at your command<br><br>we scrubbed the blood<br>of our dead<br>paramours from floors, from chairs<br><br>from stairs, from doors,<b><br></b>we knelt in water<br>while you stared<br><br>at our bare feet<b><br></b>it was not fair<br>you licked our fear<br><br>it gave you pleasure<b><br></b>you raised your hand<br>you watched us fall<br><br>we danced on air<b><br></b>the ones you failed<br>the ones you killed<br><br><b>iii<br>My Childhood</b><br>Where shall I begin? There are only two choices: at the beginning or not at the beginning. The real beginning would be the beginning of the world, after which one thing has led to another; but since there are differences of opinion about that, I&#x2019;ll begin with my own birth.<br><br>My father was King Icarius of Sparta. My mother was a Naiad. Daughters of Naiads were a dime a dozen in those days; the place was crawling with them. Nevertheless, it never hurts to be of semi-divine birth. Or it never hurts immediately.<br><br>When I was quite young my father ordered me to be thrown into the sea. I never knew exactly why, during my lifetime, but now I suspect he&#x2019;d been told by an oracle that I would weave his shroud. Possibly he thought that if he killed me first, his shroud would never be woven and he would live forever. I can see how the reasoning might have gone. In that case, his wish to drown me came from an understandable desire to protect himself. But he must have misheard, or else the oracle herself misheard &#x2014; the gods often mumble &#x2014; because it was not his shroud that was at issue, but my father-in-law&#x2019;s shroud. If that was the prophecy it was a true one, and indeed the weaving of this particular shroud proved a great convenience to me later on in my life.<br><br>The teaching of crafts to girls has fallen out of fashion now, I understand, but luckily it had not in my day.

She tells her story in <i>Homesick, My Own Story</i>, a Newbery Honor Book. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ms Fritz is the author of forty-five books for children and young people.

We're Writing the Constitution! ) here presents a brisk, highly accessible biography of James Madison. Sickly as a child, Madison was a short, frail man with a wispy, small voice. His successes in incorporating personal freedoms into a reasonably strong centralized government and his enormous appetite for work earned him the sobriquet "great." Madison's shyness and difficulty with public speaking were drawbacks during the politician's early days in Virginia government--as was the enmity of a powerful Patrick Henry--but behind-the-scenes speaking effectiveness and voluminous, well-reasoned writings more than compensated. In her characteristic way of bringing history to life, Fritz writes in a highly engaging, entertaining manner, providing vivid descriptions of Madison's close friendship with Thomas Jefferson; his long and apparently happy marriage to Dolly; the infighting during the creation of the Constitution; the patience with which our fourth president dealt with an unreasonable England, leading to the war of 1812--and that war's defeats and victories.

Darwin&#x2019;s theory has withstood 150 years of scientific scrutiny, and today it not only explains the origin and design of living things, but highlights the importance of a scientific understanding in our culture and in our lives.<br><br>Recently the movement known as &#x201c;Intelligent Design&#x201d; has attracted the attention of journalists, educators, and legislators. The scientific community is puzzled and saddened by this trend&#x2013;not only because it distorts modern biology, but also because it diverts people from the truly fascinating ideas emerging from the real science of evolution. Here, join fifteen of our preeminent thinkers whose clear, accessible, and passionate essays reveal the fact and power of Darwin&#x2019;s theory, and the beauty of the scientific quest to understand our world.</p><p><b>John Brockman</b> is a writer, agent, and publisher of <i>Edge</i>, the "Third Culture" website (www.edge.org), the forum for leading scientists and thinkers to share their research with the general public. He is the author of <i>By The Late John Brockman</i> and <i>The Third Culture</i> and has edited several previous anthologies including <i>The Next Fifty Years, Curious Minds</i>, and<i> My Einstein</i>. He lives in New York City.Jerry A. Coyne<br><br> Intelligent Design: The Faith That Dare Not Speak Its Name<br><br> <i> Intelligent design is not an evangelic Christian thing, or a generally Christian thing or even a generically theistic thing. . . . Intelligent design is an emerging scientific research program. Design theorists attempt to demonstrate its merits fair and square in the scientific world-without appealing to religious authority.</i><br><br> -William A. Dembski, <i>The Design Revolution</i> (2004)<br><br> <i>[A]ny view of the sciences that leaves Christ out of the picture must be seen as fundamentally deficient. . . . [T]he conceptual soundness of a scientific theory cannot be maintained apart from Christ.</i><br><br> -William A. Dembski, <i>Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science &amp; Theology</i> (1999)<br><br> Well, which is it? Is intelligent design (ID) merely a sophisticated form of biblical creationism, as most biologists claim, or is it science-an alternative to Darwinism that deserves discussion in the science classroom? As the two quotations above imply, you won't find the answers in the writings of the leading advocates of ID.<br><br> The ambiguity is deliberate, for ID is a theory that must appeal to two distinct constituencies. To the secular public, ID proponents present their theory as pure science. This, after all, is their justification for a slick public-relations campaign promoting the teaching of ID in the public schools. But as is clear from the infamous "Wedge Document" of the Discovery Institute, a right-wing think tank in Seattle and the center for ID propaganda, intelligent design is part of a cunning effort to dethrone materialism from society and science and replace it with theism.1 ID is simply biblical creationism updated and disguised to sneak evangelical Christianity past the First Amendment and open the classroom door to Jesus. The advocates of ID will admit this, but only to their second constituency, the sympathetic audience of evangelical Christians on whose support they rely.<br><br> Nevertheless, let us give the ID movement the benefit of the doubt. Let us suppose that ID might indeed be an alternative and superior scientific theory-one that explains the natural world better than Darwinian evolution does. Can such an argument stand up to scrutiny? Is it time for Darwinian evolution to go the way of Newtonian mechanics, as a theory good for its time but ripe for replacement by a new paradigm? No. Not only is ID markedly inferior to Darwinism at explaining and understanding nature but in many ways it does not even fulfill the requirements of a scientific theory.<br><br> What are those requirements? A scientific theory isn't just a guess or speculation, it is a convincing explanatory framework for a body of evidence about the real world. A good scientific theory makes sense of wide-ranging data that were previously unexplained. In addition, a scientific theory must make testable predictions and be vulnerable to falsification. Einstein's theory of relativity, for example, received a definitive test (and confirmation) by measurements of the bending of starlight by the sun during a solar eclipse. If a theory can't be tested or falsified, it is not a scientific theory. The theory that God caused the Big Bang, for example, isn't a scientific theory, because (while it may be true) there are no observations we can make to disprove it. When a theory has withstood many tests and made many correct predictions, it becomes a scientific fact, which we can understand as a theory having such strong support that all rational people would accept it. The theories of atoms and of chemical bonds, for example, have graduated from theory to fact. Both could conceivably be shown to be wrong-all the data supporting the existence of atoms might have been deceptive-but it's highly unlikely.<br><br> So, how do Darwinism and ID compare when judged against these criteria? Let's start by looking at Darwinism. The modern theory of evolution, called neo-Darwinism in light of 150 years of post-Darwin research, has four parts. Put simply, these are as follows:<br><br> First, evolution occurs; that is, living species are descendants of other species that lived in the past.<br><br> Second, evolutionary change occurs through the gradual genetic transformation of populations of individuals over thousands or millions of years.<br><br> Third, new forms of life arise from the splitting of a single lineage into two, a process known as speciation. This continual splitting leads to a nested genealogy of species-a "tree of life" whose root was the first species to arise and whose twigs are the millions of species living today. Trace back any pair of twigs from modern species through the branches and you will find that they share a common ancestor, represented by the node at which the branches meet.<br><br> And fourth, much of evolution occurs through natural selection. Individuals carrying genes better suited to the current environment leave more offspring, causing genetic change in populations over time which improves the "fit" of the organism to the environment. It is this improving fit that gives organisms the appearance of having been well designed for their lifestyles.<br><br> These claims don't necessarily stand or fall together. Nevertheless, evidence supporting all four began to accumulate starting with Darwin's 1859 On the Origin of Species and continues to inundate us today. Every bit of information we have gathered about nature is consonant with the theory of evolution, and there is not one whit of evidence contradicting it. Neo-Darwinism, like the theory of chemical bonds, has graduated from theory to fact.<br><br> What is this evidence? It is immense, so I will just touch upon what Darwin himself presented, though he had only a fraction of the evidence available today. It came from the fossil record, from curious remnants persisting in the anatomy and development of living species, and from biogeography-the geographical distribution of Earth's flora and fauna.<br><br> Let's start with the obvious place to look, the fossil record. Even in Darwin's time, there was evidence here supporting evolution, in the sequence of organisms laid down in the rocks. The deepest and oldest sediments show marine invertebrates; fish appear much later, and amphibians, reptiles, and mammals later still. Why should divine creation follow such a path, from the simple to the complex? Yet it is what we would expect with evolution. Darwin also observed that the species inhabiting any region-the living marsupials of Australia, for instance-closely resemble fossils found in the same place. This suggests that the former descended from the latter. We can trace evolutionary changes in lineages through the record: Diatoms grow larger, clamshells get ribbier, horses become larger and toothier, and the human lineage evolves bigger brains, smaller teeth, and greater proficiency at walking on two legs. There are transitional forms, too-but more on those later.<br><br> Leaving behind the dead, we also find ample evidence of evolution among the living-relics that the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould dubbed "the senseless signs of history." They are many: The tooth buds developed in the embryonic stage by birds and anteaters-buds that are later aborted and never erupt-are remnants of their toothed ancestors. The tiny vestigial wings hidden under the feathers of the flightless kiwi attest to its ancestors' ability to fly. Some cave-dwelling animals have rudimentary eyes that cannot see, degenerate remnants of their ancestors' sighted ones. What creator, or guiding intelligence, would give animals such useless tooth buds, wings, or eyes?<br><br> Our bodies, too, are a palimpsest of our ancestry. The appendix is a familiar example. Less well known is the bad design of the recurrent laryngeal nerve-a nerve that runs from the brain to the larynx, helping us speak and swallow. In mammals, this nerve doesn't take a direct route but descends into the chest, loops around the aorta near the heart, and then runs back up to the larynx. It is several times longer than it needs to be; in the giraffe the nerve has to traverse the neck twice and so is fifteen feet long-fourteen feet longer than necessary! The added length makes the nerve more susceptible to injury, and its tortuous path makes sense only in light of evolution. We inherited our developmental pathway from that of ancestral fish, in which the precursor of the recurrent laryngeal nerve attached to the sixth of the gill arches, embryonic bars of muscle, nerves, and blood vessels that developed into gills. During the evolution of land animals, some of the ancestral vessels disappeared, while others were rearranged into a new circulatory system. The blood vessel in the sixth gill arch moved backward into the chest, becoming the aorta. As it did so, the nerve that looped around it was constrained to move backward in tandem. Natural selection could not create the most efficient configuration because that would have required breaking the nerve and leaving the larynx without innervation.<br><br> Look deeper and you find evidence for evolution buried in our DNA. Our genome is a veritable farrago of nonfunctional DNA, including many inactive "pseudogenes" that were functional in our ancestors. Why do humans, unlike most mammals, require vitamin C in their diet? Because primates cannot synthesize this essential nutrient from simpler chemicals. Yet we still carry all the genes for synthesizing vitamin C. The gene used for the last step in this pathway was inactivated by mutations 40 million years ago, probably because it was unnecessary in fruit-eating primates.<br><br> Is this really the best an "intelligent" designer can do? IDers claim that arguments for evolution based on inefficiencies or vestigial structures are unscientific because they supposedly include an unjustified theological assumption that a designer would not create such structures. But IDers are missing the point here. The evolutionary argument is that these imperfections and inefficiencies make sense only if one assumes that evolution has occurred! They comport with creationism only if you believe that the creator deceptively designed all organisms to delude us into thinking that they had evolved.<br><br> And finally, what of biogeography? This yields some of the most powerful evidence for evolution. It was Darwin's genius in the Origin to show that the distribution of plants and animals made sense only by assuming that species had evolved and split into additional species. Let's take his argument about the wildlife of oceanic islands-islands that, like the Gal�pagos and Hawaii, were never connected to continents but arose, bereft of terrestrial life, from beneath the sea. Compared with continents or continental islands, these islands have bizarrely unbalanced flora and fauna-unbalanced in that they are missing or impoverished in many types, while others (especially plants, insects, and birds) are present in profusion, consisting of clusters of numerous similar species "radiations." Hawaii, for example, has no native terrestrial mammals, reptiles, or amphibians but has large radiations of fruit flies and silversword plants. One third of the world's 2,000 species of fruit flies are found on the archipelago, although it makes up only 2 percent of the land on Earth.<br><br> Moreover, the animals and plants inhabiting an oceanic island are most similar to those species found on the nearest mainland, often despite great differences in habitat. Darwin's clinching point was this: The kinds of wildlife commonly found on oceanic islands are those that could get there easily, carried by winds, ocean currents, or other animals. Clearly, novel species on oceanic islands descend from those that were able to colonize from the nearest mainland and subsequently evolved and speciated on the islands. Only unplanned evolution makes sense of all these observations of island biogeography. No theory of design or creation even begins to explain them.<br><br> Darwin had strong evidence for evolution but no direct evidence for natural selection as the process by which it occurs. He relied on logical argument-the existence of variation in populations and its influence on reproductive success, from which natural selection followed inevitably-and on analogy with the artificial selection used by breeders to produce forms as diverse as Chihuahuas and St. Bernards from wolves, and cauliflower and Brussels sprouts from wild cabbage, within a mere 1,000 years or so.<br><br> But vast amounts of evidence have accumulated since Darwin's time. Biologists have now observed hundreds of cases of natural selection, beginning with the well-known examples of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, insect resistance to DDT, and HIV resistance to antiviral drugs. Natural selection accounts for the defense of fish and mice against predators via camouflage and for the adaptation of plants to toxic minerals in the soil. And the strength of selection observed in the wild, when extrapolated over long periods, is more than adequate to explain the diversification of life on Earth.<br><br> Neo-Darwinian evolution passes with flying colors the test of a scientific theory as an explanatory framework for wide-ranging evidence. What a remarkably elegant theory it is, and what a vast body of evidence it explains! It makes sense of data from fields as diverse as paleontology, biogeography, embryology, anatomy, and molecular biology. The geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously declared, "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." One might add that nothing in biology makes sense in the light of intelligent design.<br><br> But can neo-Darwinism make predictions? And is it falsifiable? Yes, and yes again. As a historical science, it cannot be expected to predict the future. But it can, nevertheless, make powerful predictions.<br><br> Darwin himself made predictions from his theory. The age of the earth was unknown in his time, but he predicted that it would be old, to allow time for evolution to produce the existing diversity of life. We now know that Earth is 4.6 billion years old. He also predicted that if plants on oceanic islands were descended from those on continents, the seeds of continental plants should be able to survive prolonged immersion in seawater, and he confirmed this prediction with experiments described in the <i>Origin</i>.<br><br> Developments in biology after Darwin have served to confirm other predictions of evolutionary theory: For example, in order for natural selection to operate, there must be plenty of heritable variation in wild populations of plants and animals. We now know the source of this variation (a problem that baffled Darwin): mutations in DNA. Research in the past century has uncovered ample genetic variation for nearly every trait in every species studied.<br><br> We also now understand that natural selection involves the differential reproduction of genes. That means there should be examples of selection that benefit the genes themselves and not their carriers. Recent studies have thoroughly confirmed this prediction. In the production of eggs and sperm, for example, there is normally a 50 percent probability of each of our two gene copies going into each gamete. But there are some "selfish genes" that kill their partners and so get overrepresented...</p><h2>The Little Book of Advent</h2><p><p>The Little Book of Advent is an indispensable collection of readings from some of the most celebrated modern-day spiritual writers, with passages specially selected for each day of Advent.</p><p>These carefully chosen insights come from men and women, lay and ordained, across the denominational spectrum, and their wisdom is combined with both a suggested scripture passage, and a prayer to make your own.</p><p>This book can be used either for self-reflection or to spark discussion in groups during an Advent course.

Back home, he hunted down terrorists and modernized Jordan's Special Forces. Then, suddenly, he found himself king. Together with his wife, Queen Rania, he transformed what it meant to be a monarch, going undercover to escape the bubble of the court while she became the Muslim world's most passionate advocate of women's rights. <br><br> In this exceptionally candid memoir, King Abdullah tackles the single toughest issue he faces head-on- how to solve the Israeli-Palestinian standoff- and reveals himself to be an invaluable intermediary between America and the Arab world. He writes about the impact of the Iraq war on his neighborhood and how best to tackle Iran's nuclear ambitions. <br><br> Why would a sitting head of state choose to write about the most explosive issues he faces? King Abdullah does so now because he believes we face a moment of truth: a last chance for peace in the Middle East. The prize is enormous, the cost of failure far greater than we dare imagine.</p><p>King Abdullah II spent his formative years in the United States, where he went to Eaglebrook and Deerfield, and in England, where he trained to be an officer at Sandhurst. A cavalry officer in the Jordanian army, he eventually became commander of the Jordanian Special Forces, a position that allowed him to forge invaluable relationships with intelligence and military offices around the world. The head of the Hashemite family, he is a forty-third generation direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammad.

His place of birth was Denison, Texas, but when he was one, his family moved to Abilene, Kansas. This is the place where he grew up and went to school, where he is buried and where all his documents are stored in the splendid Eisenhower Presidential Library.</p><p>The Eisenhowers, who were of German origin (the name means &#x201c;iron hewer&#x201d;), had come to what is now the United States in 1741. They were Mennonites, an Anabaptist sect that fled European militarism and practiced the austere virtues of primitive Christianity. The father, David, received 160 acres and $2,000 from his family, but lost it all when his business failed, an event that had a powerful impact on all his boys. He was deeply religious and read the Bible in Greek, but he ruled with a stick. When Ike, as he was always known, was asked at a press conference in July 1954 about his pacifist background, he replied, laughing, &#x201c;There was nothing pacific about my father.&#x201d; His mother, on the other hand, who played the piano and taught the boys hymns, was a passionate pacifist who wept when Ike went away to West Point, though she accepted it as God&#x2019;s will. His brother Milton recalled: &#x201c;I never saw my mother cry until Ike became a cadet.&#x201d;</p><p>Ike&#x2019;s father worked at an Abilene creamery on Mennonite land. The family read the Bible, morning and evening, on their knees. But Ike, as an adult, never belonged to a church until he became president, when he was baptized at the Washington, D.C., National Presbyterian Church, &#x201c;to set an example.&#x201d; But his life was always conducted within highly disciplined channels. As a boy he rose at five a.m. to lay and light the fires. Throughout his adult life his diaries record that he habitually rose at six, and on many days worked till eleven p.m. &#x201c;Seven hours&#x2019; sleep is plenty,&#x201d; he would say. Abilene was a community that encouraged personal industry. A former cow town with a colorful past, it prided itself on being self-policing, having no crime and all its males gainfully employed. Its four thousand inhabitants were Christians of European descent, most of whom voted Republican and conformed to Norman Rockwell patterns.</p><p>Ike had blue eyes, light brown hair, an infectious grin, which was his hallmark throughout his life, and a pugnacious and competitive character. He grew to nearly six feet with a weight of 170 pounds, which never varied much. He ate sensibly, drank moderately and got regular exercise. This took the form of football, at which he excelled until a knee injury forced him to switch to coaching. His coaching skills became a huge asset in his military career, and he kept fit by taking up golf, a passion that never left him, even after he achieved a hole in one (February 6, 1968). He always stressed teamwork, as coach, general and president. He was self-assured but never conceited&#x2014;humility was a much-prized Mennonite virtue. He loved hunting, fishing and camping, and he organized sporting trips. The Eisenhower boys helped one another to get through college by earning money in turn. Ike&#x2019;s original plan was to study law at the University of Michigan, which had one of the best football teams in the country, but his friend Everett Hazlett, with whom he exchanged letters for half a century (they are published), persuaded him to get a place at the United States Military Academy at West Point, which was free. Two applicants each year were recommended by the local U.S. senator, Joseph Bristow.</p><p>The senator held an annual competitive exam for which Ike crammed. It was exactly the kind of challenge he liked, a two-day contest involving eight bright local boys. He got 99 out of 100 in grammar, 94 in algebra, 96 in arithmetic, 90 in spelling, 79 in general history, 73 in U.S. history, 77 in geometry, and 90 in geography, and with an 87.3 average, he won a place. He always liked history and, as a boy, read a great deal of Greek, Roman and American history&#x2014;and remembered it. One of his presidential speechwriters, the learned Arthur Larson, known as the Republican egghead, recalled Ike correcting him when he referred to Alcibiades the Just. &#x201c;No, Arthur, you mean Aristides the Just.&#x201d; Ike loved reading about Lincoln, and learned passages from his main speeches by heart. From military history he loved to quote Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s obiter dicta, especially his key saying: &#x201c;Duty is the most beautiful word in the English language.&#x201d;</p><p>Ike worked through the full four-year course at West Point, during what he claimed was the toughest period in its history, just before the United States entered the First World War. The life was spartan, but this was nothing new. Rote learning was the rule. Ike excelled at English and was at the top in essay writing. His talent for coaching was fully exploited and he became more devoted to teamwork, which became a salient part of his philosophy of life. He found the school fascinating: Lee&#x2019;s room, Grant&#x2019;s room, the field where Custer learned to ride. His first year as a plebe, which involved much hazing by senior cadets, was redeemed by ceremony and bands, which Ike relished. As a senior himself he never hazed plebes. He hated regimentation for its own sake. His only black mark was for smoking, strictly forbidden, which meant he was 125 out of the total intake of 164 under &#x201c;discipline.&#x201d; His overall final position was 61 out of the 164 graduates, of whom 59 eventually became brigadier generals (one star) or higher, two of them generals of the army (five stars). Ike enjoyed West Point and greatly benefited from it. His knee injury ruled out the cavalry, so his first posting, as a second lieutenant, was to the infantry at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, in 1915.</p><p>Ike developed one lifelong characteristic at West Point: a tendency to conceal any intellectual interests or cerebral accomplishments. &#x201c;Academic&#x201d; was a term of abuse at the Academy. He liked to be considered a &#x201c;regular guy&#x201d; and took to reading Westerns to hide his passion for military history. This curious practice became habitual. Richard Nixon said to me: &#x201c;I served General Eisenhower as his Vice-President for eight years. He was by far the most devious man I ever met in my life.&#x201d;</p><p>He was also exceptionally well mannered and courteous. He was capable of ferocious bouts of temper, but these were kept under strict control and unleashed only when required for a definite purpose. All this he owed, in the first instance, to his wife, whom he married in July 1916. Mamie Geneva Doud was born in Boone, Iowa, but the family moved to Denver when Mamie was seven, and that is the place with which she identified. Her father had made a modest fortune in meatpacking, and the family was affluent. Her father employed a chauffeur, and Mamie had her own lady&#x2019;s maid. At sixteen she was sent to Miss Wolcott&#x2019;s finishing school, Denver&#x2019;s &#x201c;prime academy for young ladies.&#x201d; She thought Ike &#x201c;the best-looking man I had ever met,&#x201d; and while determined to marry him, she was also clear about the ways in which he could be improved. She spotted immediately that he was a man of unusually high intelligence with a strikingly wide vocabulary, but she removed many rusticities from his manners and accent and the rough traits he had acquired at West Point. As she had a horror of flying, she also forbade his half-formed notion of becoming an army flier (he had begun taking lessons) and got her father to tell Ike that the marriage could not take place unless he renounced any such ambition (Ike complied).</p><p>&#x201c;It was a case,&#x201d; Mamie said, &#x201c;of someone from a family of boys mating with someone from a family of girls&#x2014;I had three sisters and no brothers.&#x201d; They had quite a hard time of it living on army pay. They moved more than twenty-five times in Ike&#x2019;s army career, and never owned a house until they bought their retirement home, a farmhouse at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. &#x201c;I learned a lesson, early,&#x201d; she confessed ruefully. &#x201c;Our first big move, I sold the household furniture, which included some valuable wedding presents. I thought it would be simpler. All I got was $95! It took us years and years to replace them properly. So in future I never parted with anything. Put it into storage, if necessary, and filled the attic with old clothes.&#x201d;</p><p>Mamie was tremendously important to Ike at every stage of his life and career. They got on because each respected the other&#x2019;s markedly different habits. Ike never got up later than six a.m., except in very unusual circumstances. Mamie preferred, like Churchill, to do her administrative work in bed and rarely rose before ten a.m. or even noon. As they advanced up the pyramid, Mamie regarded Ike&#x2019;s working times and areas as sacrosanct and never penetrated them. &#x201c;When Ike was President I only went into the Oval Office four times, and each time I was invited.&#x201d; On the other hand, she had a remarkable memory for faces and names, was a frugal housekeeper, however large the establishment, and kept everything that was within her province under tight control. J. B. West, the chief usher at the White House, said: &#x201c;She had a spine of steel, formed by years of military discipline. She understood a large household, knew exactly what she wanted every moment and exactly how to get it done.&#x201d; She trimmed down the staff, imposed a no-talking rule and kept her own schedules strict military secrets.</p><p>Ike himself asserted, of his presidency: &#x201c;She made the White House livable, comfortable, and meaningful.&#x201d; And: &#x201c;I got it into my head I&#x2019;d better listen when she talked about someone brought in close to me.&#x201d; And: &#x201c;I always sought Mamie&#x2019;s advice on financial matters. She was keen on budget savings. Yes, Sir!&#x201d; Mamie was never pretty, but she was always trim and did Ike credit. With a height of five feet four inches and about 135 to 140 pounds in weight, which never varied much, she was named in 1952 one of the best-dressed women in the world by the New York Dress Institute. She popularized short bangs, pastel-colored stockings and Elizabeth Arden&#x2019;s Main Chance health spa in Phoenix, Arizona. When Ike ran for office, rumors flew that Mamie drank. Someone had the hardihood to raise the issue at a press conference in 1953. Making a visible effort to control himself, Ike said: &#x201c;To the best of my knowledge, Mrs. Eisenhower has not had a drink for eighteen months.&#x201d; But it was Mamie herself who finally laid the issue to rest in 1973 during a TV interview, when she said that a carotid sinus condition sometimes affected her balance. (She also suffered from a mild form of claustrophobia.) This would explain why she was sometimes said to be unsteady on her feet. Whether alcohol ever contributed to this behavior is unclear: the evidence is contradictory. She was never a chronic drunk&#x2014;far from it&#x2014;and my view is that the stories about her drinking were invention, circulated by political enemies of Ike&#x2019;s who found him an extraordinarily difficult man to attack on personal grounds.</p><p>What is indisputable is that Mamie made Ike a good and loving wife and was a distinct asset in his career, especially in its early stages. While the First World War lasted, Ike prospered mightily. From Fort Sam Houston he was sent to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, as an instructor in the Officers&#x2019; Training Corps, and promoted to captain, then sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He then became involved in the Tank Corps, a rapidly expanding branch of the army, first at Gettysburg, then at Camp Meade, Maryland. His enthusiasm led to rapid promotion, first to major, then to lieutenant colonel. He was on notice for overseas service when the signing of the armistice in November 1918 suddenly put military expansion into reverse. Ike found himself returned to his substantive rank, captain, then promoted to major, in which he remained for sixteen years.</p><p>Moreover, his keenness for armored warfare was ill regarded by his superiors, who stigmatized it as arrogant and impertinent, especially as he was still nominally an infantryman and without battle experience of any kind. His application to attend the Command and General Staff School at Leavenworth was savagely turned down, and instead he found himself executive officer of the Twentieth Infantry Brigade in the Panama Canal Zone.</p><p>This disappointment, however, turned out to be a blessing. It brought him to the attention of General Fox Conner. This gifted and unusual man was the first of Ike&#x2019;s guardian angels in his career. He had been chief of staff to General John J. Pershing, was a staff officer of exceptional brilliance and recognized the same propensities in others. He could see that Ike was a born staff man with an unusual combination of qualities. Conner reported that Ike was precisely the kind of officer who ought to attend the Staff School, and saw to it that he went there in 1925. Ike loved the school and came out first when he graduated the following year.</p><p>What were the qualities Conner spotted? First was a clear, analytical intelligence. Second, he had the ability to articulate conclusions in excellent English&#x2014;any kind of paperwork came naturally to him. Third, he could get on well with anyone, especially hard cases&#x2014;which were common in an army where thrusting individualism was encouraged and promoted. He was, fourth, adept at resolving differences and promoting solutions, especially compromises that worked. Fifth, he had admirable persistence in pursuing reason in any military enterprise. Sixth, he concealed his strengths. Seventh, Ike was very hardworking, often for prolonged periods, yet he always appeared relaxed. All these qualities were bound together by an eighth virtue: consistent aims in life, quietly but vigorously followed. The effect of the Staff School was to confirm this combination, and especially to enable Ike to get his thoughts onto paper in a pellucid manner, something very rare in the U.S. Army, indeed in any army. It also implanted in Ike a keen realization of the connection between military power and industrial capacity, which became a salient part of his thinking about the future.</p><p>Ike&#x2019;s high ratings at the Command and General Staff School should have ensured him a wide choice of military posts when he graduated. And indeed for a short time in 1926&#x2013;27 he was commander of the Second Battalion of the Twenty-fourth Infantry. But he then chose to serve on the American Battle Monuments Commission, under the auspices of the Army War College. This took him to Washington, D.C., and to its Paris headquarters, for the best part of 1928 and into 1929. As Ike often complained that his one aim was to serve with battle troops, it may seem curious that he volunteered for this post. The reasons are that it involved travel, which he and Mamie enjoyed; that it brought him into contact with senior officers from all arms of the service; but above all, that it involved tricky and arduous administrative tasks of a kind he was beginning to relish, and perform well.</p><p>An examination of letters written by Ike during his service on the ABMC shows him to have become a meticulously efficient administrative officer who wrote clear, correct and pungent English, and was an inveterate enemy of muddle, jargon and bureaucracy. A characteristic remark reads: &#x201c;In my opinion we cannot afford to permit years of work in obtai...</p></p><h2>They&#39;re Watching</h2><p><i>&#x201c;Riveting, emotionally rich, original, and beautifully written, this book kept me up too late reading, had me sneaking in pages the next day. </i>They&#x2019;re Watching <i>reminded me what it&#x2019;s like to be in the thrall of a great story: helpless until the end, loving every minute of it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lisa Unger, </i>New York Times <i>bestselling author of </i>Die for You <p></p>Patrick Davis is a man with troubles.

Hundreds of people looked everywhere for the child but could not find her. At one point, someone suggested that Barbara had been kidnapped and killed by Jews, and as the search continued, policemen and townspeople alike gave credence to the quickly spreading rumors. The allegation of ritual murder, known to Jews as &#x201c;blood libel,&#x201d; took hold.</p><p>To believe in the accusation seems bizarre at first glance&#x2015;blood libel was essentially unknown in the United States. But a great many of Massena&#x2019;s inhabitants, both Christians and Jews, had emigrated recently from Central and Eastern Europe, where it was all too common. Historian Edward Berenson, himself a native of Massena, sheds light on the cross-cultural forces that ignited America&#x2019;s only known instance of blood libel, and traces its roots in Old World prejudice, homegrown antisemitism, and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. Residues of all three have persisted until the present day.</p><p>More than just the disturbing story of one town&#x2019;s embrace of an insidious anti-Jewish myth, <em>The Accusation</em> is a shocking and perceptive exploration of American and European responses to antisemitism.</p> 29 illustrations</p><p><strong>Edward Berenson</strong> is a professor of history at New York University. He is the author of <em>Europe in the Modern World</em> and <em>The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story</em>.

Berenson&#x2019;s research ranges widely over time and space, and his narrative deftly blends scholarly generalizations with nitty-gritty historical reconstruction. The highly readable result is a tour de force of insight and synthesis.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter Hayes, author of <em>Why?

Edward Berenson, a distinguished historian of modern Europe, opens up a side of early twentieth-century American history that feels both startling and eerily familiar in its mix of ethnocentrism and political toxicity. A lucid, deeply intelligent, and important book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven J. Zipperstein, author of <em>Pogrom: Kishinev and the Tilt of History</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Accusation</em> starts with what amounted to an obscure footnote in regional narratives and a minor curiosity in studies of American Jewish history, and builds upon it a very large, important story. In a richly woven tapestry, Edward Berenson examines the many strands that link early twentieth-century Massena, New York, to the Middle Ages, when Jews found themselves accused of using the blood of young Christians to bake matzo, their ritual Passover bread. Deftly connects the very local to the national and to the global.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hasia R. Diner, Paul S. and Sylvia Steinberg Professor of American Jewish History, New York University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A blood libel in twentieth-century America? In an ordinary American town? In his astonishing study of this tainted fable, Edward Berenson, a distinguished historian with family roots in Massena, New York, uncovers the reason we ought not to be astonished: the blood libel is the lie that never dies. In its multiple mercurial guises, and in the latest headlines, it lives on. <em>The Accusation</em> is not mere history. It is news.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cynthia Ozick, author of <em>Foreign Bodies</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In an improbable age when chants from Charlottesville, &#x2018;Jews will not replace us!,&#x2019; and synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh and San Diego evoke darker times of antisemitic violence, <em>The Accusation</em> is a frightful reminder that even in the United States, when the conditions are right, it can happen here. A wonderful and important book that, given current events, leaves its final chapter still unwritten.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thane Rosenbaum, author of <em>The Myth of Moral Justice: Why Our Legal System Fails to Do What's Right</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Edward Berenson&#x2019;s meticulous, intricate history of the European roots of &#x2018;blood libel&#x2019; anti-Semitism&#x2015;and the single time a small American town fell into its thrall&#x2015;is a stellar example of the universal importance of historical research. <em>The Accusation</em> isn&#x2019;t just the story of Barbara Griffiths&#x2019; disappearance, and the unfounded claim that shook the small Jewish community in Massena, New York&#x2015;more importantly, it&#x2019;s the story of <em>how</em> it happened, and how it could happen again.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rebecca Schuman, author of <em>Schadenfreude, A Love Story</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Accusation</em> is a gripping and disturbing account, told in calm and measured prose, of how one of history&#x2019;s most persistent slurs&#x2015;the Blood Libel against Jewish communities across Europe and the Near East&#x2015;resurfaced in small-town America in the 1920s. Its focus may be specific, but its relevance is boundless and important: our understanding of immigration, the complexities of xenophobia, and the dangerous tenacity against all reason of racial myths are all enhanced in this fascinating marriage of scholarship and storytelling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jim Crace, author of the National Book Critics Circle Award Winner, <em>Being Dead</em></strong></p><h2>Fluffy Goes Apple Picking (level 3) (Hello Reader)</h2><p>Fluffy LOVES apples!

Murray was given unparalleled access to Hooker, and he lets the man from Clarksdale, Mississippi, tell his own story. "Everything you read on album covers is not true, and every album reads different," he told Murray. Murray helps Hooker set the record straight, disentangling the myths and legends from truths so rock-ribbed that we understand, as if for the first time, why they have provided the source for a lifetime of unforgettable sound.<br> <br>Murray weaves together Hooker's life and music to reveal their indissoluble bonds. Yet <i>Boogie Man</i> is far more than merely an accomplished and brilliant biography of one man; it gives an account of an entire art form. Grounded in a time and place in American culture, the blues are universal, and in the hands of the greatest practitioners its power resides in the miracle of using despair to transcend it. "The preacher's mantle," Murray tells us, "passes to the bluesman." This bluesman traveled a hard road out of the American South, from obscurity to adulation and back-and back again. John Lee Hooker has seen it all and sung it all, and his music is both a living legacy and an American treasure. Here is the book that does him and his music full justice.<br></p><p><b>Charles Shaar Murray</b> won the Ralph J. Gleason Award for Crosstown Traffic, his critically acclaimed study of Jimi Hendrix. <i>Q Magazine</i> dubbed him the "rock writers' rock writer" and "the consummate rock critic." He lives in England.<br>John Lee Hooker became an overnight sensation in the '80s after more than 40 years at his craft. The springboard for his "discovery" was the Grammy-winning album <i>The </i>Healer, which featured Bonnie Raitt and Carlos Santana among other younger musicians. This gambit, too, was not new, for Hooker had recorded <i>Hooker 'n' Heat</i> with Canned Heat in the late '60s--a truly seminal album. Hooker is one of the last surviving bluesmen with a direct lineage from the Delta blues tradition and for years was king of Detroit's blues scene. Murray's extensive bio goes all the way back to the beginning in a sprawling literary effort worthy of Hooker's lengthy career. Like many American blues artists, Hooker was revered by the early '60s English rockers, yet unlike Muddy Waters, widespread pop music interest in Hooker was slow to build. Nevertheless, Hooker's music is a national treasure; anybody who has ever boogied to George Thorogood's recording of Hooker's "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" or rocked out to ZZ Top's early recordings has heard the man's influence. Now they can read his life story in depth and celebrate Hooker and his music in a way that many of his contemporaries never lived to enjoy. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now the inimitable Tim Gunn shares his personal secrets for &#x201c;making it work&#x201d;&#x2014;in your career, relationships, and life. Filled with delightfully dishy stories of fashion&#x2019;s greatest divas, behind-the-scenes glimpses of <i>Runway</i>&#x2019;s biggest drama queens, and never-before-revealed insights into Tim&#x2019;s private life, <i>Gunn&#x2019;s Golden Rules </i>is like no other how-to book you&#x2019;ve ever read.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>In the world according to Tim, there are no shortcuts to success. Hard work, creativity, and skill are just the beginning. By following eighteen tried-and-true principles, you can apply Tim&#x2019;s rules to anything you set your mind to. You&#x2019;ll learn why Tim frowns on displays of bad behavior, like the vitriolic outburst by Martha Stewart&#x2019;s daughter about her mother&#x2019;s name-brand merchandise. You&#x2019;ll discover the downfalls of divadom as he describes <i>Vogue</i>&#x2019;s Andr� Leon Talley being hand-fed grapes and Anna Wintour being carried downstairs by her bodyguards. And you&#x2019;ll get Tim&#x2019;s view on the backstabbing by one designer on <i>Project Runway </i>and how it brilliantly backfired.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Then there are his down-to-earth guidelines for making life better&#x2014;for yourself and others&#x2014;in small and large ways, especially in an age that favors comfort over politeness, ease over style. Texting at the dinner table? Wearing shorts to the theater? Not in Tim&#x2019;s book. Living a well-mannered life of integrity and character is hard work, he admits, but the rewards are many: being a good friend, being glamorous and attractive, and being a success&#x2014; much like Tim himself!<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>He is never one to mince words. But Tim Gunn is always warm, witty, wise, and wonderfully supportive&#x2014; just the mentor you need to design a happy, creative, and fulfilling life that will never go out of style.</p><p>Beloved pop culture icon and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Tim Gunn is best known as the Emmy Award&#x2013;winning host of <i>Project Runway</i>. He also hosted two seasons of his own Bravo makeover series, <i>Tim Gunn&#x2019;s Guide to Style</i>, and was the host of the reality TV series <i>Under the Gunn</i>.<b>RULE 1<br><br><b>Make It Work!</b></b><br><br>AS A LITTLE KID, when confronted with a difficult situation, I would run and hide somewhere in our Washington, D.C., house. I wanted to escape from the world. School, sports, church, birthday parties&#x2014;anything social terrified me. All I wanted to do was hole up until the event had passed and I could go back to reading alone in my room.<br><br>Unfortunately, I couldn&#x2019;t stay hidden for very long, because the house wasn&#x2019;t that big and eventually my mother figured out my favorite hiding places. But usually it would be long enough to scare the living daylights out of her, which for me was not an unhappy side effect.<br><br>As my mother caught on to each new scheme, I got more creative. I think it was maybe the third or fourth time I hid, I actually ran away outside and found a good secluded spot in the yard. I was thrilled when I heard her inside tearing the house apart. Finally, I had really succeeded in terrorizing her. I could have stayed out in that yard forever.<br><br>Well, unfortunately for my escapist fantasies, we had a basset hound, Brandy. My mother sent Brandy out to find me, and she did so immediately.<br><br>This made me more determined. I thought: <i>I need to get smarter about this. I need to run away</i> with <i>Brandy.</i><br><br>That didn&#x2019;t work, either, because my parents would yell for me and Brandy would bark back.<br><br>Then it became a challenge to run away with her <i>and</i> to keep my hand over her mouth.<br><br>The whole project got more and more complicated until, ultimately, I decided it was less trouble just to stay home and be miserable.<br><br>In that moment, the seeds of &#x201c;make it work!&#x201d; were born. Running away from my problems didn&#x2019;t help. I had to face up to whatever it was that I didn&#x2019;t want to deal with&#x2014;my homework, an angry parent, a fight with a friend&#x2014;rather than just trying to put it off until it went away. Until you address them, I have since learned, such problems never truly vanish.<br><br>I had to make the best of the bad situation. What I found was that if I did that, the situation would rapidly become less bad, whereas if I hid from it or tried to make it go away, I would get more and more anxious and the situation would get worse and worse. I learned very early the wisdom of making it&#x2014;whatever <i>it</i> was&#x2014;work.<br><br>The phrase &#x201c;make it work!&#x201d; came later, but it didn&#x2019;t originate on <i>Project Runway</i>. I began using it in my classroom when I was a design teacher at Parsons, the celebrated design college in Manhattan where I worked for twenty-four years. I found it to be an extremely useful mantra when my students were in trouble.<br><br>One such example came during a later phase of my academic career. I was teaching Concept Development to seniors. This was a six-hour class that met once a week for the entire academic year&#x2014;two fifteen-week semesters. It was a long time to work on a single project, and students learned a lot by having to go deep into their own unique concepts.<br><br>The year began with the crystallization of each student&#x2019;s thesis: five to seven head-to-toe looks that represented their point of view as a designer. (It was Joan Kaner, the celebrated style maven and former vice president of Neiman Marcus, who once said to me, &#x201c;I can tell everything that I need to know about a designer from five looks.&#x201d; I think about that all the time.)<br><br>Those looks were executed in muslin (an unbleached cotton fabric used for prototyping) in a corresponding course that was appropriately called Studio Methods. I would visit that class on a regular basis, especially during fittings, which happened every two weeks.<br><br>On the topic of fittings, I forbade my students from designing for themselves or using themselves as fit models for their collection. Why? Because when you wear your own designs, you lose objectivity. It&#x2019;s important that each designer maintain a well-honed ability to critically analyze his or her own work. If you&#x2019;re only ever designing for your own body, you&#x2019;d better be prepared to have a clientele of one.<br><br>I like the <i>Project Runway</i> Season 7 designer Ping Wu, who famously used herself as a mannequin, as a person even though she&#x2019;s exhausting to be around. She has so much personality. When I told her at the end of Episode 3, &#x201c;The workroom won&#x2019;t be the same without you,&#x201d; I meant it! I had to talk Jesse LeNoir off a ledge during their team challenge. He&#x2019;s a lovely guy and quite talented. He recognized many of the problems the judges saw, but he couldn&#x2019;t convince Ping to fix them.<br><br>When we had the auditions, I found her work compelling but her pieces were all hand knits. I said, &#x201c;How do you translate this to <i>Project Runway</i>? Would you do sewn knits? They won&#x2019;t have the same M�bius-strip quality.&#x201d;<br><br>In some ways I think she was handicapped by being a hand-knit designer, and by using herself as a dress form. As you may remember, in Episode 2, the model&#x2019;s rear end was hanging out of her skirt. It was vulgar. Ping&#x2019;s practice of using herself as a model clouded her objectivity. I think that&#x2019;s a big part of why she made it only to Episode 3.<br><br>One instance in which &#x201c;make it work!&#x201d; came in particularly handy was during the spring semester of 2002. One of my students, Emma, was seriously struggling with the silhouette and proportions of the items that made up the looks in her collection. We had three fit models before us, and frankly, the collection was a hot mess.<br><br>I was struggling, too, in my efforts to get Emma to see solutions. What exactly was it that was so wrong? Even I couldn&#x2019;t describe it. The only word that came to mind was <i>everything.</i> She was frustrated to the point of tears when she declared that she was going to throw everything away and begin again from scratch.<br><br>&#x201c;You are not starting over,&#x201d; I responded. &#x201c;Besides, even if I agreed that you should, you&#x2019;ve put twenty-five weeks into this collection, and it will be presented to the thesis jury in a month. It will be impossible to present anything of quality in that short amount of time.&#x201d; (This was before <i>Project Runway,</i> which would recalibrate my thinking about time!)<br><br>&#x201c;Then what am I going to do?&#x201d; Emma asked, looking at me helplessly.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have time to reconceive your designs, to shop for new fabric, or to make new muslins,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to diagnose the issues with your collection and offer up a prescription for how to fix it. You don&#x2019;t need to start from scratch! What&#x2019;s at the core of this is working. The problems have to do with fit and proportion. Do you need to create new patterns? No! You need to take these existing pieces and retool them. You&#x2019;re going to make it work!&#x201d;<br><br>And she did. Emma&#x2019;s collection was a success, and she learned so much from seeing it through.<br><br>If you look at the process of creating a work of art or a design as a journey of one hundred steps, steps one through ninety-five are relatively easy. It&#x2019;s the last five that are hard. How do you achieve closure? How do you finish it? That&#x2019;s the hard part.<br><br>MAKING IT WORK MEANS finding a solution to a dilemma, whether it&#x2019;s a senior-year thesis collection, a difficult boss, or a flat tire. When my students made it work, they reached a new level of understanding about their abilities to successfully problem solve, and that gave them additional resources when moving forward to the next task at hand. When we figure a way out of a tricky situation in our own lives, we learn something and gain confidence in ourselves. Making it work is empowering.<br><br>On <i>Project Runway,</i> the phrase serves as a constant reminder of the seriousness of our deadlines and of the finite limitations of each designer&#x2019;s material resources; in other words, when we return from shopping at Mood, that&#x2019;s it. Whatever they purchased is what they have to execute the challenge. If they discover that they&#x2019;re without some critical ingredient, then they&#x2019;re stuck, and it&#x2019;s &#x201c;make-it-work&#x201d; time.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a big difference between my relationship with my students and my relationship with the <i>Project Runway</i> designers. When my students were in a jam, I could tell them what to do to get out of it. By decree, I cannot tell the <i>Project Runway</i> designers what to do, nor can I assist them in any way other than through words. I learned this the hard way.<br><br>During Season 1, Austin Scarlett was having difficulty threading one of the sewing machines. In my then state of na�vet�, I sat down at the machine to help. After all the years I&#x2019;ve spent around designers, I can thread a sewing machine with my eyes closed.<br><br>Within seconds, one of the producers called me out of the sewing room.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a sewing machine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It will take me one minute to fix.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But if you do that for Austin, then all of the other designers will expect you to do it for them,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And if you don&#x2019;t, then it may be perceived that Austin had an unfair advantage.&#x201d;<br><br>I hadn&#x2019;t thought of that. She was right. I had to let go and watch the designers struggle. It took a little while, but eventually I got used to this new role as a hands-off mentor.<br><br>But I still enjoy being a hands-on instructor whenever I get the chance. I love how fresh young minds are, and I love watching them grow to take in new information. It&#x2019;s so satisfying to see them come out the other end of the school year more sophisticated and closer to knowing what they need to know in order to accomplish their goals.<br><br>Truth be told, I never dreamed that I would become a career educator. In fact, it&#x2019;s ironic, because growing up I hated school. And I do mean <i>hated.</i><br><br>Don&#x2019;t misunderstand me: I loved learning. As a child, I always had a million creative projects going on at home. But I hated the social aspects of school. I was a classic nerd with a terrible stutter. I preferred the sanctuary of my bedroom, and I was crazy about books because they transported me to another time and place (one far less oppressive than Beauvoir, the National Cathedral Elementary School in the 1960s, I can assure you). I was also crazy about making things: I was addicted to my Lincoln Logs, Erector Set, and especially my Legos.<br><br>I would spend almost all of my weekly allowance on Legos. And in my youth, Legos weren&#x2019;t packaged in the prescriptive way they are now; they came as a bunch of anonymous blocks that you would purchase according to size and color, plus doors, windows, and, later&#x2014;be still my beating heart&#x2014;roof tiles.<br><br>As you can probably imagine, between my stutter and my fetishizing of Lego textures, at school I was taunted and teased. I knew that I wasn&#x2019;t one of the cool kids, and I never tried to pretend otherwise. I was always the last kid picked for games at recess. (Perhaps it&#x2019;s no wonder that I hate, loathe, and despise team sports even to this day.)<br><br>My big macho FBI-agent father, George William Gunn, was J. Edgar Hoover&#x2019;s ghostwriter, and he not entirely happy about the oddness of his only son. He coached the Little League team and did everything he could to get me on a sports field. It was a disaster. I was bullied. I was beaten up.<br><br>Looking back, it seems like having a tough-guy father would have been helpful, but the truth was, he really never seemed to understand me, so we never had much of a relationship. And oddly enough, even when he knew I was getting pummeled at school, he didn&#x2019;t teach me how to fight back. He never once said, &#x201c;Let me show you how to sock someone.&#x201d;<br><br>The result was that I was a terrible fighter. I thought I was going to be a concert pianist (yes, I was every kind of nerd), so I would not hit for fear of breaking a hand. That meant I was a biter and a hair puller. If you got into a tangle with me, that&#x2019;s what would happen. You&#x2019;d get bitten and have your hair pulled. I wouldn&#x2019;t even know what I was biting. I would just be in a frenzy, biting anything I could get a hold of.<br><br>An interviewer once asked me, &#x201c;Who would win in a fight, you or Michael Kors?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s easy: Michael Kors,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m a hair puller, and he barely has any hair. There&#x2019;s not enough to hold on to.&#x201d;<br><br>When I was older and had to declare a sport, it was swimming. I loved swimming primarily because it&#x2019;s solitary&#x2014;that and you don&#x2019;t sweat. (My sense of propriety was off the charts even back then.) Furthermore, I was good at it, especially the breaststroke and backstroke. In an unexpected and extremely appreciated show of support, my father took up coaching the swim team.<br><br>So I had swimming and my grades to be proud of. I also had the piano, which I studied for twelve years and became quite good at, but there was no reason to share that tease-worthy tidbit with my classmates. And yet, I was flailing. What was I going to be truly good at? What would it take to prove to my peers that I did in fact have value other than as a punching bag? For a long time I had no idea.<br><br>My teaching career began in an innocent enough way. When I was twenty-five years old, a former and much beloved teacher, Rona Slade, invited me to be her teaching assistant for a summer course for high school students at the Corcoran School of Art (now the Corcoran College of Art), one of the nation&#x2019;s last remaining museum schools and my alma mater (class of &#x2019;76).<br><br>They really care about craft there. The Pre-College Intensive Workshop met six hours a day, five days a week, for a month. Rona and I had a great time and played off each other well. I felt proud that I could help someone for whom I had so much respect.<br><br>At that point I was a financially strapped sculptor who made ends meet by building models for architecture firms in Washington. Although I enjoyed model making, it wasn&#x2019;t very lucrative when one factored in the vast amount of time required to make each model. I was probably making about a dollar an hour.<br><br>But I loved sculpture. One of my favorite artists is the sculptor Anne Truitt. When I first saw her work in 1974, I was transformed. It was like the first time I saw a painting by the abstract expressionist Mark Rothko. I felt physically lifted off the ground. I&#x2019;ve always thought the reason Truitt wasn&#x2019;t as well known as she deserves to be is that she doesn&#x2019;t easily fit into any particular genre&#x2014;neither in the Washington Color School nor the Minimalists. There&#x2019;s not a box to put her in, so she gets lost. I was so lucky later to study under her and then to speak at the opening of her posthumous retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2009.<br><br>In any case, when Rona asked me to stay on at the end of the summer of 1978 to work at the college, I jumped at the chance. The position would include teaching a three-dimensional design course as part of the first year of studies. Furthermore, it was full-time, which meant that it came with benefits. Even better, it paid a whopping $6,000 per academic year. Needless to say, I was ecstatic.<br><br>But then, when it got closer to my start date, I was terrified.<br><br>I realized I had no idea how I would fare in the classroom without Rona at my side. Would I be teased as I had been in grade school? Would the students throw paper planes and spitballs? Would they tie me up and hurl me out the window and into the parking lot? The more I thought about it, the more g...</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2><p>The Dursleys were so mean that hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br><br>And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.<br><br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><p>It's hard to fall in love with an earnest, appealing young hero like Harry Potter and then to watch helplessly as he steps into terrible danger! And in J.K. Rowling's <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. <p> Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware." But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment.

The world's first international porn superstar makes a series of startling allegations in the most referred-to book ever written about the adult movie industry. When Linda Lovelace starred in 1972's "Deep Throat", she had already made several stag films under the auspices of partner and director Chuck Traynor. To her, "Throat" was just another 8mm porn movie. To the world, it was a symbol of sexual liberation and a groundbreaking landmark in cinema history - the first ever theatrically released flesh flick. The film and its starlet became household names. Frank Sinatra, Gregory Peck, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Truman Capote and Bob Woodward saw it on its first run. The enthusiastic Lovelace seemed an icon of a strange kind of liberation.<p></p>So, when the gleefully fellating nurse of the world's first "proper" porn movie wrote her third biography in 1980, flatly contradicting earlier claims and falling solidly in with her newfound image as a champion of women's rights and hardcore feminist, the porn world and the people who had seen "Throat" on its seemingly perpetual run through the adult cinemas of West Coast America were flabbergasted. Lovelace's claims that Traynor had coerced her into not only her role in "Deep Throat", but also her (far more hardcore and apparently just as enthusiastic) parts in his earlier underground shorts through systematic abuse, death threats and at gunpoint were met with open derision by the porn establishment and restrained glee by the puritan mainstream. Modern porn stars have gone on record to observe that the practices Lovelace claims were de rigeur for the industry she knew are non-existent: Lovelace herself further fuelled the argument by partly retracting her allegations in the admission that "Throat" revolutionised the love lives of thousands of couples, and that if this was the case, then the movie itself was "OK."<p></p>The most talked-about porn memoir of all time, and a vital component in the on-running and increasingly vitriolic porno morality debate.</p><h2>We Can Remember It for You Wholesale: and Other Classic Stories by Philip K. Dick</h2><p>A collection of Philip K. Dick&#39;s earliest works features &#34;We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,&#34; in which Doug Quail, unable to afford a trip to Mars, pays a visit to Rekal to have memories implanted.</p><p>More than 30 years after his untimely death at age 53, <b>Philip K. Dick </b>(1928&#x2013;1982) remains one of the most celebrated authors of the last century and a looming and illuminating presence in this one. He was the winner of both the prestigious Hugo Award and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, which honor excellence in science fiction. Inducted in 2007 into the Library of America, which published a three-volume collection of his novels, Dick has received unprecedented recognition for his contributions to modern literature, specifically in the area of science fiction. His 45 novels and more than 210 short stories have been adapted into numerous films, including the blockbusters <i>Minority Report</i>, <i>Total Recall</i>, and <i>Blade Runner</i>, as well as <i>Impostor</i>, <i>Paycheck</i>, <i>Scanner Darkly</i>, <i>Next</i>, and <i>The Adjustment Bureau</i>.</p><h2>A Future for Amazonia: Randy Borman and Cof�n Environmental Politics</h2><p><p>Blending ethnography with a fascinating personal story, A Future for Amazonia is an account of a political movement that arose in the early 1990s in response to decades of attacks on the lands and peoples of eastern Ecuador, one of the world's most culturally and biologically diverse places. After generations of ruin at the hands of colonizing farmers, transnational oil companies, and Colombian armed factions, the indigenous Cof�n people and their rain forest territory faced imminent jeopardy. In a surprising turn of events, the Cof�n chose Randy Borman, a man of Euro-American descent, to lead their efforts to overcome the crisis that confronted them.</p><p>Drawing on three years of ethnographic research, A Future for Amazonia begins by tracing the contours of Cof�n society and Borman's place within it. Borman, a blue-eyed, white-skinned child of North American missionary-linguists, was raised in a Cof�n community and gradually came to share the identity of his adoptive nation. He became a global media phenomenon and forged creative partnerships between Cof�n communities, conservationist organizations, Western scientists, and the Ecuadorian state. The result was a collective mobilization that transformed the Cof�n nation in unprecedented ways, providing them with political power, scientific expertise, and a new role as ambitious caretakers of more than one million acres of forest. Challenging simplistic notions of identity, indigeneity, and inevitable ecological destruction, A Future for Amazonia charts an inspiring course for environmental politics in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Michael Cepek is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Texas at San Antonio and a fellow in the Division of Environment, Culture, and Conservation at the Field Museum of Natural History. He began working with the Cof�n people of Amazonian Ecuador in 1994 and continues to collaborate with them on academic and activist projects."It is a well-crafted and nicely combined account of an ethnographic study with the personal story of Randy Borman...it is a must read for all those who want to understand the ecological sustainability efforts of indigenous people around the world in general, and the success story of the Cof�n in Amazonia in particular." (<i>Indigenous Peoples, Issues, and Resources</i> 2013-07-10)<br><br>"We must thank Michael Cepek for an ethnography that not only sheds light on indigenous cultural resistance, but also allows us to imagine such questions." (<i>Journal of Latin American Studies</i> 2013-07-01)<br><br>"What&#x2019;s the fate of the Amazon&#x2019;s ecology and indigenous people? Is cultural and biological destruction inevitable? This may be the predominant message we hear emanating from the global discourse, but, as we read in Michael Cepek&#x2019;s lively and richly textured account of the Cof�n people of eastern Ecuador, we may have reason to be more optimistic." (<i>American Ethnologist</i>)<br><br>"It is exciting and always refreshing to read an ethnography that, as Cepek puts it, uses empirical investigation of an existing liberatory project to help us conceptualize alternative futures of hope and possibility." (<i>American Anthropologist</i>)<br><br>"A Future for Amazonia is ideal for those in search of a rich, readable, ethnography that provides a remarkably rich account of an Amazonian indigenous people and how they have developed the political capacity to take on multinational oil, negotiate the Ecuadorian state, and secure a future that is at least partially hopeful. In short, this book makes an argument for why ethnography remains important for understanding much of what defines Latin America, from natural resource extraction and imperialism to indigenous movements, the &#x2018;NGOization&#x2019; of political life, and the broader struggle for cultural and economic survival." (<i>Anthropology and Humanism</i>)<br><br>"This book will be of interest to environmental anthropologists for its depiction of divergent cultural models of environmental conservation and ecological cosmovisions, and to scholars in Latin American studies for its analysis of indigenous social movements and their complex relationships with states and transnational NGO networks. It also makes important contributions to the emerging field of NGO studies by examining how the adoption of the NGO form entails the transformation of community identities and practices. Nonetheless, its greatest value lies in the way it challenges anthropologists to examine the cultural tools used by people to refashion their ways of living in order to secure some measure of control over their future in a complex and often unpredictable global context." (<i>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</i>)<br><br>"Cepek has done a marvelous job in documenting and explaining the nuances and narratives of the Cof�n story. . . . The book, which is easy to read and very well written, is highly recommended, especially for anyone working in International Development, Development Education, Government, Conservation, or Anthropology. The larger value here is that Cepek provides a pragmatic vision, gained through his sustained relationship with Borman and the Cof�n,which might help the world with its problem of maintaining biodiversity. It is a real life story, implemented and worked on by real people, not just a utopian vision. The accomplishments of the 'Cof�n experiment' deserve to be carefully studied and debated" (<i>Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology</i>)<br><br>"One of the best Latin American ethnographies I&#x2019;ve read in a decade. . . . The reader comes away from this work with a strong sense of a people who are not &#x2018;timeless indigenous others&#x2019; but thoughtful individuals struggling to keep their social world afloat against formidable odds. Cepek brings extraordinary ethnographic texture to his account and raises our understanding of indigenous survival to a new level." (Michael F. Brown, Lambert Professor of Anthropology and Latin American Studies, Williams College)<br><br>"Brave . . . original. . . . A thought-provoking and sensitive account of the complexities of Cof�n life in a global age. Written with clarity and commitment, this book will surely unsettle assumptions."

As the starving group struggled beyond the limits of what seemed possible, Canessa played a key role in safeguarding his fellow survivors, eventually trekking with a companion across the hostile mountain range for help.<br> <br>This fine line between life and death became the catalyst for the rest of his life.<br> <br>This uplifting tale of hope and determination, solidarity and ingenuity gives vivid insight into a world famous story. Canessa also draws a unique and fascinating parallel between his work as a doctor performing arduous heart surgeries on infants and unborn babies and the difficult life-changing decisions he was forced to make in the Andes. With grace and humanity, Canessa prompts us to ask ourselves: what do you do when all the odds are stacked against you?</p><p>Dr. Roberto Canessa shocked the world in December 1972 when he and Fernando Parrado arrived in Chile after surviving a horrific plane crash and then hiking across the Andes mountains for ten days at an altitude of 16,404 feet and temperatures of twenty-two degrees below zero. Canessa and Parrado guided a rescue party back to their fourteen friends who were still trapped on the mountain two months after the initial search for them had been called off. Dr. Canessa went on to become a pediatric cardiologist,&nbsp;world-renowned for his work with newborn patients and prenatal echocardiography at the Hospital&nbsp;Italiano&nbsp;of Montevideo.<br><br>Pablo Vierci is a native of Montevideo, Uruguay, who is also an Italian citizen. He is an award-winning author and scriptwriter.I Had to Survive Chapter 1<p></p> <br>Where is the line between life and death?<br> <br>Through the screen of an ultrasound machine, I study the heart of a child about to be born. I take my time, watching the tiny hands and feet on the monitor, feeling as if we&#x2019;re communicating somehow through the screen. I&#x2019;m fascinated at this life that will soon be among us&#x2014;and at this heart that will have to be repaired in order for the child to survive.<br> <br>One moment I&#x2019;m gazing at the ultrasound screen, and the next I&#x2019;m staring out the window of the crumpled fuselage of a plane, scanning the horizon to see if my friends will return alive from their test hikes. Ever since we escaped from the plane crash in the Andes mountains on December 22, 1972, after being lost for more than two months, I have asked myself a litany of questions, which is constantly changing. Foremost among them: What do you do when all the odds seem stacked against you?<br> <br>I turn to the pregnant mother, who is lying on a gurney on the second floor of the Hospital Italiano in Montevideo, Uruguay. What is the best way to tell her that the child in her womb has developed in utero lacking the most important chamber of her heart? Until just a few years ago, newborns with these kinds of congenital heart defects, who came into the world stricken through no fault of their own, would die shortly after birth. Their only mark on the world would be a brief agony followed by a lasting trauma for their families. Fortunately, however, medicine took a crucial step forward, and this mother, Azucena, with the look of consternation on her face, can now have hope. There is a long, arduous journey ahead for this woman and her baby daughter, as well as for her husband and their two other children. It is an uncharted path as precarious as the one I made through the Andes. My friends and I were lucky enough to emerge from those mountains finally and reach the verdant valley of Los Maitenes. That&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m trying to lead these children, into their own verdant valley, although I carry the burden of knowing that not all of them will survive the journey.<br> <br>This is my dilemma as a doctor. I find myself teetering between life and death as I watch this baby, whose mother has already named her Maria del Rosario. She can live for now, tethered to the placenta in her mother&#x2019;s womb, but what is to be done afterward? Should I propose a series of long, drawn-out surgeries so that she has a chance at living? And will it be worth all the risks and costs involved? I&#x2019;m sometimes overwhelmed at the similarities between our predicaments.<br> <br>When we finally left the fuselage to trek across the peaks and chasms leading to that valley in Chile, we encountered a vast no-man&#x2019;s-land. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to remain alive in that weather, at thirty below, without any gear and after having lost nearly seventy pounds. It was impossible, everyone assumed, to trek more than fifty miles from east to west directly over the Andes, because no one in our weakened physical state would be able to withstand the rigors. We could have chosen to remain in that uterine fuselage, safe, until it, too, became inhospitable when we ran out of the only nourishment that was keeping us alive, the lifeless bodies of our friends. Just as the infant gets nourishment from the mother, we were able to do so from our friends, the most precious thing we had in that world. Should we stay or should we go? Remain huddled or press forward? The only equipment we had to help us on our journey was a sleeping bag we cobbled together out of insulation from the pipes of the plane&#x2019;s heating system, stitched with copper wire. It looked like something plucked from a landfill.<br> <br>This child, still a fetus, still connected to her source of nourishment, can survive a little longer, just as we did in the fuselage. But one day, as with us, the cord will have to be cut if she is to live, because we are in a race against time. I was the last one to decide to venture out, and that&#x2019;s why this recurring image has remained with me, intense and haunting. When should we cut the cord? When should we subject ourselves to the ordeal of attempting to cross the hostile mountain range? I knew that a hasty decision to trek across the mountains carried great risk, just as premature labor does for these children with congenital heart defects.<br> <br>It took me a lot of deliberation to make my choice. There were simply too many factors, but I knew we were down to our last chance. Nando Parrado understood my doubts because he was wary as well, although he couldn&#x2019;t say this out loud for fear of letting down the rest of the survivors of the plane crash. With each person who died, we all died a little bit, too. It wasn&#x2019;t until Gustavo Zerbino told me that one of the bravest of our friends, Numa Turcatti, had died, that I decided it was time to go. It was time to leave the safety of the fuselage, to be born with a heart that wasn&#x2019;t ready for the outside world. One of my friends, Arturo Nogueira, who&#x2019;d had both of his legs broken in the crash and eventually perished, told me, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so lucky, Roberto, that you can walk for the rest of us.&#x201d; Otherwise he might have been the one here today, in my place.<br> <br>I was nineteen years old, a second-year medical student, a rugby player, and Lauri Surraco was my girlfriend when our plane crashed into the mountain that October 13, 1972. Those seventy days on the mountain were literally a crash course in the medicine of catastrophes, of survival, where the spark for my vocation would become a roaring flame. It was the most brutal of laboratories, where we were the guinea pigs&#x2014;and we all knew it. In that sinister proving ground, I gained a new perspective on medicine: To be healed meant simply to survive. Nothing I learned since could compare with that ignoble birth.<br> <br>In the hospitals where I&#x2019;ve worked, some of my colleagues have criticized me, behind my back and to my face, for being domineering, impetuous, for flouting the rules or going beyond what&#x2019;s considered proper conduct&#x2014;something my companions on the mountain accused me of at times as well. But patients don&#x2019;t care about the social mores of a medical corporation; they come to a hospital and then go home, no longer subject to its rules. My ways are the ways of the mountains. Hard, implacable, steeled over the anvil of an unrelenting wilderness in which only one thing matters: the fight to stay alive.</p><h2>The Girl in the Ice: A Konrad Simonsen Thriller</h2><p><p>Under the heartless vault of Greenland's arctic sky the body of a girl is discovered.

We all knew who it was. A turncoat Norwegian monk named Naddod had been big medicine on the dragon-and-blight circuit for the last decade or so, and was known to bring heavy ordnance for whoever could lay out some silver. Scuttlebutt had it that Naddod was operating out of a monastery on Lindisfarne, whose people we&#x2019;d troubled on a pillage-and-consternation tour through Northumbria after Corn Harvesting Month last fall. Now bitter winds were screaming in from the west, searing the land and ripping the grass from the soil. Salmon were turning up spattered with sores, and grasshoppers clung to the wheat in rapacious buzzing bunches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I tried to put these things out of my mind. We&#x2019;d been away three long months harrying the Hibernian shores, and now I was back with Pila, my common-law, and thinking that home was very close to paradise in these endless summer days. We&#x2019;d built our house together, Pila and me. It was a fine little wattleand- daub cabin on a pretty bit of plain where a wide blue fjord stabbed into the land. On summer evenings my young wife and I would sit out front, high on potato wine, and watch the sun stitch its orange skirt across the horizon. At times such as these, you get a good, humble feeling, like the gods made this place, this moment, first and concocted you as an afterthought just to be there to enjoy it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was doing a lot of enjoying and relishing and laying around the rack with Pila, though I knew what it meant when I heard those flint-edged winds howling past the house. Some individuals three weeks&#x2019; boat ride off were messing up our summer and would probably need their asses whipped over it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, DjarfFairhair had his stinger out even before his wife spotted those dragons winging it inland from the coast. He was boss on our ship and a fool for warfare. His appetite for action was so terrifying and infectious, he&#x2019;d once riled up a gang of Frankish slaves and led them south to afflict and maim their own countrymen. He&#x2019;d gotten in four days of decent sacking when the slaves began to see the situation for what it was and underwent a sudden change of attitude. Djarf had been fighting his way up the Rhine Valley, making steady progress through a half-assed citizens&#x2019; militia of children and farmers, when the slaves closed in behind him. People who were there say he turned absolutely feral and began berserking with a pair of broadaxes, chewing through the lines like corn kernels on a cob, and that when the axes broke, he took up someone&#x2019;s severed leg and used it as a club, so horrifying those gentle provincials that they fell back and gave him wide berth to the ship. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Djarf was from Hedeby-Slesvig up the Sli fjord, a foul and rocky locality whose people take a worrisome pleasure in the gruesome sides of life. They have a habit down there if they don&#x2019;t like a child&#x2019;s looks when he slides from the womb, they pitch him into the deep and wait for the next one. Djarf himself was supposedly a colicky baby, and it was only the beneficence of the tides and his own vicious tenacity that got him to the far beach when his father tried to wash him from the world. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He&#x2019;d been campaigning for payback ever since. I guess I was with him on a search-and-destroy tour against Louis the Pious, and with my own eyes watched him climb up over the soldiers&#x2019; backs and stride across their shoulders, scything skulls as he went. On that same trip, we ran low on food, and it was Djarf who decided to throw our own dead on the fire and have at last night&#x2019;s mutton when their stomachs burst. He&#x2019;d been the only one of us to dig in, apart from a deranged Arab along as a spellbuster. He reached right in there, scooping out chewed-up victuals with a shank of pine bark. &#x201c;Greenhorns,&#x201d; he called us, the firelight twitching on his face. &#x201c;Food&#x2019;s food. If these boys hadn&#x2019;t gotten their threads snipped, they&#x2019;d tell you the same thing.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Djarf, whose wife was a sour, carp-mouthed thing and little argument for staying home, was agitating to hop back in the ship and go straighten things out in Northumbria. My buddy Gnut, who lived just over the stony moraine our wheat field backed up on, came down the hill one day and admitted that he, too, was giving it some thought. Like me, he wasn&#x2019;t big on warrioring. He was just crazy for boat. He&#x2019;d have rowed from his shack to his shithouse if somebody would invent a ship whose prow could cut sod. His wife had passed years ago, dead from bad milk, and now that she was gone, the part of Gnut that felt peaceful in a place that didn&#x2019;t move beneath him had sickened and died as well. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pila saw him coming down the hill and scowled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t need to guess what he&#x2019;ll be wanting,&#x201d; she said, and headed back indoors. Gnut ambled down over the hummocky earth and stopped at the pair of stump chairs Pila and I had put up on the hill where the view was so fine. From there, the fjord shone like poured silver, and sometimes you could spot a seal poking his head up through the waves. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gnut&#x2019;s wool coat was stiff with filth and his long hair so heavy and unclean that even the raw wind was having a hard time getting it to move. He had a good crust of snot going in his mustache, not a pleasant thing to look at, but then, he had no one around to find it disagreeable. He tore a sprig of heather from the ground and chewed at its sweet roots. </p><p>&#x201c;Djarf get at you yet?&#x201d; he asked. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not yet, but I&#x2019;m not worried he&#x2019;ll forget.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He took the sprig from his teeth and briefly jammed it into his ear before tossing it away. &#x201c;You gonna go?&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not until I hear the particulars, I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You can bet I&#x2019;m going. Ahydra flew in last night and ran off Rolf Hierdal&#x2019;s sheep. We can&#x2019;t be putting up with this shit. It comes down to pride, is what it comes down to.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell, Gnut, when&#x2019;d you get to be such a gung-ho motherfucker? I don&#x2019;t recall you being so proud and thin-skinned before Astrud went off to her good place. Anyhow, Lindisfarne is probably sacked-out already. If you don&#x2019;t recall, we pillaged the tar out of those people on the last swing through, and I doubt they&#x2019;ve come up with much in the meantime to justify a trip.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wished Gnut would go ahead and own up to the fact that his life out here was making him lonely and miserable instead of laying on with this warrior-man routine. I could tell just to look at him that most days he was thinking of walking into the water and not bothering to turn back. It wasn&#x2019;t combat he was after. He wanted back on the boat among company. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not that I was all that averse to a job myself, speaking in the abstract, but I was needing more sweet time with Pila. I cared more for that girl than even she probably knew, and I was hoping to get in some thorough lovemaking before the Haycutting Month was under way and see if I couldn&#x2019;t make us a little monkey. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the days wore on and the weather worsened. Pila watched it closely, and the sadness welled up in her, as it often did when I&#x2019;d be leaving. She cussed me on some days, and others she&#x2019;d hold me to her and weep. And late one evening, far toward dawn, the hail started. It came suddenly, with the rasping sound a ship makes when its keel scrapes stone. We hunkered down in the sheepskins, and I whispered soothing things to Pila, trying to drown out the clatter. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sun was not yet full up in the sky when Djarf came and knocked. I rose and stepped across the floor, which was damp with cold dew. Djarf stood in the doorway wearing a mail jacket and shield and breathing like he&#x2019;d jogged the whole way over. He chucked a handful of hail at my feet. &#x201c;Today&#x2019;s the day,&#x201d; he said with a wild grin. &#x201c;We got to get it on.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, I could have told him thanks anyway, but once you back down from one job, you&#x2019;re lucky if they&#x2019;ll even let you put in for a flat-fee trade escort. I had to think long-term, me and Pila, and any little jits we might produce. Still, she didn&#x2019;t like to hear it. When I got back in bed, she tucked the covers over her face, hoping I&#x2019;d think she was angry instead of crying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The clouds were spilling out low across the sky when we shoved off. Thirty of us on board, Gnut rowing with me at the bow and behind us a lot of other men I&#x2019;d been in some shit with before. Some of their families came down to watch us go. �rlStender fucked up the cadence waving to his son, who stood on the beach waving back. He was a tiny one, not four or five, standing there with no pants on, holding a baby pig on a hide leash. Some of the others on board weren&#x2019;t a whole lot older, rash and violent children, so innocent about the world they would just as soon stick a knife in you as shake your hand. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gnut was overjoyed. He laughed and sang and put a lot of muscle into the oar, me just holding my hands on it to keep up appearances. I was missing Pila already. I watched the beach for her and her bright red hair. She hadn&#x2019;t come down to see me off, too mad and sad about me leaving to get up out of bed. But I looked for her anyway, the land scooting away with every jerk of the oars. If Gnut knew I was hurting, he didn&#x2019;t say so. He nudged me and joked, and kept up a steady flow of dull, merry chatter, as though this whole thing was a private vacation the two of us had cooked up together. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Djarf stood at hi...</p></p><h2>When Louis Armstrong Taught Me Scat</h2><p>In a CRACKITY-SNAPPITY-POPPITY-POP bubblegum dream, a young girl learns to scat from the master himself, Louis Armstrong!

This, then, is something I know: the thought it takes to do physical work. Such work put food on our table, gave shape to stories of affliction and ability, framed how I saw the world. I come from a family of immigrants who, with two exceptions, did not finish high school, and who worked in blue-collar or service jobs all their lives. I did not do so well in school myself, spent several years in the vocational track, and squeaked my way into a small college on probation&#x2014;the first in the family to go beyond high school. Measures of intellectual ability and assumptions about it are woven throughout this history. So I&#x2019;ve been thinking about this business of intelligence for a long time: the way we decide who&#x2019;s smart and who isn&#x2019;t, the way the work someone does feeds into that judgment, and the effect such judgment has on our sense of who we are and what we can do.<br><br> It was tough work that my family did. I would later come to understand the dynamics of occupational status and social class, but I could sense early on how difficult the work was, and that without it, we&#x2019;d starve. I also saw that people knew things through work. And they used what they learned. This experience was all very specific to me, not abstract, emerging from the lived moments of work I had witnessed, from all sorts of objects and images, from sound and smell, from rhythms of the body. These sensory particulars stay with me, resonant.<br><br> There was a table covered with slick plastic in the center of my grandmother&#x2019;s kitchen. Anyone who visited drank a cup of coffee there, wooden chair turned sideways to talk to her as she cooked. All meals were eaten at this table. My uncle Frank, a welder for the Pennsylvania Railroad, has come in from work, soiled denim, the smell of machinist&#x2019;s oil in it, his face smeared with soot. He washes at the kitchen sink, sleeves rolled up, scrubbing his arms, full lather, angling them under the faucet. He settles in at the table; there&#x2019;s a radio at its edge, and he turns it on to hear the evening news. My grandmother sets a large plate of steaming macaroni before him, deep red sauce; there is a bowl of chops, cooked earlier, in the center of the table. Frank&#x2019;s hands are huge, and as he talks to us&#x2014;a deep voice that can quickly rise in amazement&#x2014;he tears off a big chunk of Italian bread and begins to eat with a focus and capacity that made its way into the comic tales told about him by his brothers, stories I would acquire through the hearing. After a while, he pushes the chair back, but not too far, unbuttons the top of his trousers, says he&#x2019;s eaten way too much, dear Lord, and reaches for a chop, or for that loaf of bread, and leans in again, a deep pleasure against the bitter cold and exhaustion of the roundhouse.<br><br> Frank was a guy who made it a point to know things; he read a lot and inquired until he understood how something worked. It felt good to be with him. I remember him, his well-spoken voice, guiding me through the Railroader&#x2019;s Museum: cutaways of running gear; diagrams and technical information on steam, diesel, and electric locomotives; photos of wooden freight cars, cabooses, the interiors of luxury passenger cars; posed workmen; lots of repair equipment; an operational model railroad. I knew of Frank&#x2019;s many complaints about the railroad: layoffs and erratic scheduling, the brutal hours, the biting cold or sweltering heat, the burns over his arms and legs. But Frank also saw himself as a &#x201c;railroad man,&#x201d; someone who had made his contribution to this major American industry. Doing a job well mattered. &#x201c;Work hard,&#x201d; he wrote to his son, away in the army. &#x201c;No one likes a half-assed man.&#x201d; One of the moments I remember from that day at the museum, a simple but lasting one, is Frank standing before a display case, pointing to some miniature assembly of cable and gear, explaining in detail how it worked, taking his time until I got it. Many testaments have been written, both in fiction and memoir, about the physical labor of our forebears: from accounts of the prairie farm, the mills, and the mines to tales of immigrant life&#x2014;the Lower East Side to the agricultural fields of Central and Southern California. One of the most stirring moments in Mario Cuomo&#x2019;s keynote address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention is the memory of his father working long and hard hours in the family grocery store, teaching the young Mario &#x201c;all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example.&#x201d; Such invocation speaks powerfully to Americans, stirs things deep in our cultural and personal histories. How interesting it is, though, that our testaments to physical work are so often focused on the values such work exhibits rather than on the thought it requires. It is a subtle but pervasive omission. Yet there is a mind at work in dignity, and values are intimately related to thought and action.<br><br> It is as though in our cultural iconography we are given the muscled arm, sleeve rolled tight against biceps, but no thought bright behind the eye, no image that links hand and brain. I find myself here wondering about Cuomo&#x2019;s father. I imagine the many decisions he had to make, the alternatives large and small he weighed, the moments when he had to think quickly through his fatigue.<br><br> My mother shaped her adult identity in the restaurant business and, all the while I was growing up, worked as a waitress in coffee shops and family-style restaurants. My father and I would sometimes visit her at Coffee Dan&#x2019;s, waiting for her shift to end, riding the bus home together, her feet killing her. When she worked the counter and took cash, we would find two stools by the register; when she had the main room, we sat at the back booth where the waitresses took their break. We would pass the time with her once the lunch or dinner rush had faded. There wasn&#x2019;t much for a child to do, the hours stretched out, so I listened to the cooks and waitresses. They talked about the customers, or the boss, or each other; about the things going on at home with their kids; about how tired they were. And I watched what they did.<br><br> I remember particular people, like my mother&#x2019;s coworker Rose Goldstein, a gentle woman whose house across town we visited, and Bobbi, the new hire just out of high school, on whom I had a desperate crush. And there was a cook whose name I&#x2019;ve forgotten, but who would sit in the booth on break, smoking, solemn, food splattered all over his white uniform, down to the shoes. At the back booth, you would catch the thick smell of the grill and the whiff of stale food and cigarettes, scraped and dumped. These odors hung in my mother&#x2019;s uniform and hair. When things got busy, there was a heightened clatter of kitchen and dishwasher, and I could feel the rise in the pulse of the place: the cacophony of customers&#x2019; voices; waitresses weaving in and out, warning &#x201c;behind you&#x201d; in a voice both impassive and urgent; all these people eating separately in one big public space.<br><br> I remember the restaurant&#x2019;s lingo, remember liking the code of it. Tables were labeled by the number of chairs&#x2014;and, thus, customers&#x2014;around them: deuces, four-tops, six-tops. Areas of the restaurant had names: the racetrack was the speedy front section. Orders were abbreviated for the cook: fry four on two, my mother would call out as she clipped a check onto that little rotating wheel. To speak this language gave you a certain authority, signaled know-how.<br> I have many images of my mother at work, distinct from the other domains of her life: her walking full-tilt with an armload of plates along one arm and two cups of coffee somehow cradled in her other hand; her taking orders, pencil poised over pad; her flopping down in the booth by my father, the whoosh of the cushion; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all in,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say, and whisper something quickly to us about a customer. She would stand before a table, her arm stacked with those plates, picking one order off for this person, then another, then another&#x2014;always seeming to get it right, knowing who got the hamburger, who got the fried shrimp. She&#x2019;d argue with the cook over a returned order; &#x201c;he gave me lip,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d tell us, rushing by. I remember her sitting sideways at the back booth, talking to us, her one hand gripping the outer edge of the table, watching the floor, and noting, in the flow of our conversation, who needed something, who was finishing up, whose order was taking longer to prepare than it should.<br><br> What did I come to know about work like Frank&#x2019;s or my mother&#x2019;s, mechanical-industrial or life in the restaurant? Surely, that it was hard, physically taxing, dirty, injurious. I never knew my grandfather&#x2014;he died of pneumonia before I was born&#x2014;but I heard, with some frequency, a story about him losing his leg in the railroad stockyards, the same place where Frank worked. This was not the kind of work my parents and uncles and aunts wanted their kids to do. I knew, as well, that work was unsteady; you could lose your job, with disastrous consequences. Hard as it was, railed against as it occasionally was, work was coveted, for it was a stay against poverty. One reason my mother valued waitressing was that she knew she could always find work. I also got the clear sense from observing people in my family or in the neighborhood that having work, though you&#x2019;d be wiped out at day&#x2019;s end, affected your overall mood, your bearing. The men in the neighborhood who were out of work were unhappily at loose ends, sitting around, listless, time on their hands. My mother bemoaned the physical punishment of her job, but she spoke as well about &#x201c;being among the public.&#x201d; The phrase carried for her a claim of achievement. The Pennsylvania Railroad had Frank&#x2014;had much of the town&#x2014;in its grip, and he cursed it often. But he was, finally, a railroad man&#x2014;hard work, masculine, with national consequence. The work that my uncle and my mother did affected their sense of who they were, and, though limiting in so many ways, it provided a means of doing something in the world. Doing something in the world. I couldn&#x2019;t have expressed it this way when I was growing up, but the work I saw connected in my mind with agency and competence&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what being an adult meant to me, and it was intimately tied to physical work. And, as does any child, I craved competence. Special terminology caught my ear, the idiom of freight trains or food orders, because not everyone could speak it, especially speak it the right way, and it made things happen. Particular movements of the body made things happen, too, in the restaurant or the stockyard. And there was knowledge of tools and devices, wrenches and hacksaws and measures, but the cash register, too, and the whirring blender. Tied to this knowledge were tricks of the trade. And what a kick it was when one of my uncles or a cook or a waitress showed me how to do something a little more effectively, with a little less effort and a little more finesse. Hold it this way. Move it in, like this. See? I became the work&#x2019;s insider, if just for a moment.<br><br> I have been a teacher for over thirty years in a wide range of settings: from kindergarten to adult literacy programs, and now in a research university&#x2019;s graduate school of education. Many of the populations I&#x2019;ve taught and studied were considered to be educationally at-risk, and questions about intellectual capacity, either implied or explicit, were ever-present. And in a school of education, issues of ability, schooling, and work are part of the conceptual terrain. One thing I&#x2019;ve learned from all this is the powerful effect our assumptions about intelligence have on the way people are defined and treated in the classroom, the workplace, and the public sphere. It seems fitting, therefore, to turn with the investigative tools I now have to the work represented by my forebears&#x2014;factory work, skilled and semiskilled trades, and service occupations&#x2014;with a focus on the mental processes involved in doing such work, the thought that enables it. To be sure, our view of occupations is shaped by the form of capitalism that has developed in the United States and by the social traditions that attend particular occupations. But running through this economic and cultural history are beliefs about mind. The Mind at Work, then, offers an analysis of physical work and intelligence and a reflection on how we might think more clearly and fairly about them.<br> Labor, as a political and social force, has diminished in power and has less immediate grab on the national imagination. The work that currently captures our fancy involves high technology, electronic media, and &#x201c;symbolic analysis.&#x201d; Trumpeted as an unprecedented kind of work, such &#x201c;knowledge work&#x201d; represents emerging opportunity. It is associated with advanced education, and there is no doubt that work of this type requires high levels of analytic skill. What concerns me, though, is the implication&#x2014;evident in popular discourse about work&#x2014;that so-called older types of work, like manufacturing or service work, are, by and large, mindless, &#x201c;neck down&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;neck up.&#x201d; (There is, by the way, a degree of historical amnesia here: each industrial generation heralds the unprecedented intellectual demands of its work.) But, though identified with another era, work of body and hand continues to create the material web of daily life. As with any human achievement, such work merits our understanding; the way we talk about it matters. And the dimension of it that is least discussed and appreciated&#x2014;and that we can continue to learn from&#x2014;is the thought it takes to do it well.<br><br> A related issue is the way we classify work itself. &#x201c;Writers on work,&#x201d; notes sociologist Steven Peter Vallas, &#x201c;routinely employ certain stock categories&#x2014;&#x2018;blue-&#x2019; versus &#x2018;white-collar,&#x2019; &#x2018;mental&#x2019; versus &#x2018;manual&#x2019; labor.&#x201d; Vallas acknowledges that these categories are sometimes useful, but we rely too heavily on them and fail &#x201c;to observe subtle commonalities between apparently different forms of work.&#x201d; These limiting categories reaffirm longstanding biases about particular occupations and cause us to miss so much: The mental processes that enable service. The aesthetics of physical labor. The complex interplay of the social and the mechanical. The choreography of hand, eye, ear, brain. The everpresence of abstraction, planning, and problem solving in everyday work.<br><br> More immediate policy deliberations about work&#x2014;I write this, for example, during a period of economic downturn and a fragile &#x201c;jobless recovery&#x201d;&#x2014;are focused on specific tangible remedies: economic stimuli, job creation, training programs, and the like. Tied to such discussions are assessments of the state of the workforce, the number unemployed, gross measures of skill level, breakouts by race and gender. And there is, as well, a broader assessment of the workforce that will be a central concern of this book: the general sense of what workers can do, their competence, their intellectual capacity. Such appraisals may well include specific measures&#x2014;for example, high school graduation as an indicator of literacy and numeracy&#x2014;but there is also a psychological and cultural dimension to this reckoning, just as there is, at least in some schools of thought, to assessments of the economy. Consider, then, an observation by labor journalist John P. Hoerr: &#x201c;Since the early days of industrialization, a peculiar notion has gained ascendancy in the United States: that wage workers and their representatives lacked the competence to handle complex issues and problems that required abstract knowledge and analytical ability.&#x201d; This sense of deficiency is in our cultural bones, and it affects, and distorts, the specific economic responses we develop, from education and job tr...</p><h2>Insight Guides Greece (Travel Guide with Free eBook)</h2><p><p><i>Insight Guides: Inspiring your next adventure</i><br>Be inspired to visit by the new edition of Insight Guide Greece, a comprehensive full-colour guide to this fascinating and beautiful country, which is one of the most culturally significant countries on earth.</p><p>Inside <b>Insight Guide Greece</b>:</p><p> <b>A fully-overhauled edition </b>by our expert Greece author.</p><p> <b>Stunning, specially-commissioned new photography</b> that brings this breathtaking country and its people to life.</p><p> <b>Highlights of the country's top attractions</b>, including Athens and the Acropolis, and the country's hundreds of islands.</p><p> <b>Descriptive region-by-region accounts </b>cover the whole country from the cultural riches of Athens, to stunning coastline at Santorini.</p><p> <b>Detailed, high-quality maps</b> throughout will help you get around and travel tips give you all the essential information for planning a memorable trip, including our independent selection of the best hotels and restaurants.</p><p><b>About Insight Guides</b>: Insight Guides has over 40 years' experience of publishing high-quality, visual travel guides.

His writings on frontier problems in cultural anthropology, psychology, and linguistics are outstanding for their provocative insights and remarkable control of factual data. His long essay on language, his principal field of study, is an illuminating exploration of various aspects of the subject. His stress on the fact that language is a cultural or social product helped to make linguistics an integral part of the study of man. The interplay of culture and personality was a field where Sapir was a pioneer and many of his essays have become classics in the social sciences. The nine contributions brought together in this volume well show the distinction and lasting quality of Sapir&#39;s work. They include &#34;Culture, Genuine and Spurious,&#34; &#34;The Meaning of Religion,&#34; &#34;Language,&#34; &#34;Cultural Anthropology and Psychiatry,&#34; and &#34;The Statue of Linguistics as a Science.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Practical Japanese Cooking: Easy and Elegant</h2><p>Sushi, yakitori, tempura, tofu, miso-the Japanese food explosion is here and many new and inviting dishes from Japan are finding their way into the Western heart and home. <br><br>For far too long Japanese food has been treated in the West as something precious and over-refined-pure elegant restaurant fare-when in fact it is prepared daily in millions of Japanese households without fuss of any kind.

Techniques, too, are represented in color and lucidly explained. Most important, however, is the selection of ingredients: only those available in supermarkets and oriental food shops in the West are used. <br><br>From the dainty and delicate dishes that have garnered Japanese cuisine a worldwide reputation to the hearty barbecue and one-pot cornucopias of fresh meat, seafood, and vegetables-all are here at their edible best, charming and accessible, in a cookbook that is a feast for the eyes as well as the family.</p><p><br>SHIZUO TSUJI was the president of the Ecole Technique Hoteli�re Tsuji, the largest culinary school in Japan. He published extensively, writing the best- selling classic <em>Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art</em> and more than thirty books on gastonomy, music and travel in Japanese.

A discerning diner by profession, the low-profile head chef is invariably recognized by former students whenever he visits any of Japan's finer restaurants.<br><br>For the original edition <br>"The striking photographs and creative design of this oversize cookbook stress the physical beauty of traditional Japanese cuisine. The wonderful surprise is that the book succeeds in making these artful effects accessible even to novices of Japanese-style preparation and cooking techniques. The most exotic-looking dishes, clam soup, for example, or jade green deep-fried shrimp, prove to be relatively simple to prepare. Unfamiliar cooking methods are illustrated by detailed, full-color sequence photographs. And in a lovely preface, Tsuji (Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art) president of a professional culinary school in Japan (where Hata is head chef), encourages newcomers to make Japanese cookery their own, experimenting, substituting, rearranging without fear that they will violate the spirit of a most adaptable cuisine." - Publishers Weekly <br><p><br>"The recipes are clear and easy to follow, and the illustrations are especially delightful, truly top high-style Japanese simplicity.

On the one hand, he searches historical records for the identity of actual people and events concealed behind the Grail epic&#x2019;s veil of romance. On the other hand, Stein deciphers Eschenbach's hidden spiritual messages, showing <i>Parzival</i> to be an esoteric document containing powerful pictures of the human being&#x2019;s inner path of development.<br><br>Stein reveals the period of the ninth century to be far deeper and more important than to be of mere historical and academic interest. It is the karmic ground from which grows the very destiny of our modern era&#x2015;the grand battle that must take place between the powers of the Grail and the hindrance of sinister anti-Grail forces at large today.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Walter Johannes Stein</b> (1891-1957) was an Austrian philosopher and a pioneer of Anthroposophy.

Stove&#x2019;s blistering attack on Richard Dawkins&#x2019; selfish genes&#x2019; and memes&#x2019; is unparalleled and unrelenting. A discussion of spiders who mimic bird droppings is alone worth the price of the book. Darwinian Fairytales should be read and pondered by anyone interested in sociobiology, the origin of altruism, and the awesome process of evolution. --Martin Gardner, author of Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience</p><p>Philosopher David Stove concludes in his hilarious and razor-sharp inquiry that Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution is &#34;a ridiculous slander on human beings.&#34; But wait! Stove is no &#34;creationist&#34; nor a proponent of so-called &#34;intelligent design.&#34; He is a theological skeptic who admits Darwin&#39;s great genius and acknowledges that the theory of natural selection is the most successful biological theory in history. But Stove also thinks that it is also one of the most overblown and gives a penetrating inventory of what he regards as the &#34;unbelievable claims&#34; of Darwinism. Darwinian Fairytales is a must-read book for people who want to really understand the issues behind the most hotly debated scientific controversy of our time.David Charles Stove (1927-1994), was an Australian philosopher of science, and essayist in the popular press. His work in philosophy of science included detailed criticisms of David Hume's inductive skepticism, as well as the alleged irrationalism of his disciplinary contemporaries Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, and Paul Feyerabend. He also marshalled a positive response to the problem of induction in his 1986 work, The Rationality of Induction. Stove was also a staunch critic of sociobiology, going as far as describing the field as a new religion in which genes play the role of gods. Stove is best known for scathing attacks on a variety of concepts, especially Popperian falsificationism, Marxism, feminism, and postmodernism. Stove remains controversial. Some regard him as one of the great and witty defenders of common sense, who managed to defeat inductive skepticism. However others are skeptical of his arguments for induction and his criticisms of the philosophies of contemporaries Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, and Paul Feyerabend, while his extreme language has led others to regard Stove as a mere reactionary and a controversialist. <p>Stove also wrote articles on a variety of topics for non-philosophical magazines. As he got older many of his articles and books became increasingly irreverent. Stove achieved increased prominence in North America in the early 2000's when Roger Kimball published a collection of his essays and since his death in 1994 four collections of his writings have been published</p></p><h2>The Disaster Diaries: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Apocalypse</h2><p>Sam Sheridan has traveled the world as an amateur boxer and mixed martial arts fighter; he has worked as an EMT, a wilderness firefighter, a sailor, a cowboy at the largest ranch in Montana, and in construction under brutal conditions at the South Pole. If he isn't ready for the Apocalypse and the fractured world that will likely ensue, we are all in a lot of trouble.<p>Despite an arsenal of skills that puts many to shame, when Sam became a father he was beset with nightmares about being unable to protect his son. With disaster images from movies, books, and the nightly news filling his head, he was slowly being driven to distraction. If a rogue wave hit his beach community, would he be able to get out? If the power grid went down and he was forced outside the city limits, could he survive in the wilderness? And let's not even talk about plagues, zombie hoards, and attacking aliens. Unable to quiet his mind, Sam decides to face his fears head-on and gain as many skills as possible.</p><p>The problem is each doomsday situation requires something unique. Trying to navigate the clogged highway out of town? Head to the best stunt driving school in the country. Need to protect your family, but out of ammunition? Learn how to handle a knife. Is your kid hurt or showing signs of mental strain? Better brush upon emergency medicine and the psychological effects of trauma. From training with an Olympic weight lifter to a down and dirty apprenticeship in stealing cars with an ex-gang member, from a gun course in the hundred-degree heat of Alabama to agonizing lessons in arctic wilderness survival, Sam leaves no stone unturned. Will it be enough if a meteor rocks the earth? Who's to say? But as Sam points out, it would be a damn shame to survive the initial impact only to die a few days later because you don&#x2019;t know how to build a fire.</p><p>A rollicking narrative with each chapter framed by a hypothetical catastrophic scenario, <i>The Disaster Diaries</i> is irresistible armchair adventure reading for everyone curious about what it might take to survive a cataclysmic event and those who just want to watch someone else struggling to find out.</p></p><p>Sam Sheridan joined the U.S. Merchant Marines after high school and then attended Harvard College, graduating in 1998. He is an amateur boxer, MMA fighter, and a student of Muay Thai and Jiujitsu. Sheridan has worked in construction at the South Pole Station in Antarctica, as a cowboy and farmhand on the largest ranch in Montana, a Wildland Firefighter in Washington State and New Mexico, a professional sailor, and a Wilderness EMT. He has written for <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>Men's Journal</i>, and is the author of two books, <i>A Fighter&#x2019;s Heart: One Man&#x2019;s Journey through the World of Fighting </i>and<i> The Fighter&#x2019;s Mind: Inside the Mental Game</i>."<i>The Disaster Diaries</i> is a <b>fascinating</b> book... Reading how Sheridan progresses through his own training further reminds me just how much our civilization hangs by a thread and just what would be expected of me to protect my own family."<br>&#x2014;<i>Wired</i><br><br>"Though it's a work of nonfiction, <i>The Disaster Diaries</i> explores every catastrophic disaster, from floods and earthquakes to sci-fi scenarios like zombie infections and escaping giant alien monsters, and asks experts around the world exactly what preparations are needed. Sheridan uncovers survival skills (first aid, hunting in the wilderness, firing a gun) as well as some craftier tricks (hot-wiring a car, constructing an igloo). But <i>The Disaster Diaries </i>isn't instructional. The apocalypse schemes serve as a lens that allows Sheridan to explore the limits of the human body and psyche and how physical and mental strength are inexplicably linked... at least <b>when the apocalypse does arrive, I can take comfort that Sam Sheridan will survive, to continue the existence of the human race and smartly researched nonfiction books</b>."<br>&#x2014;Grantland<br><br>"Sheridan understands exactly what he is doing.

An upbeat and entertaining survival guide for the end of the world</b>."<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus </i>(starred review)<br><br>"Although this would make a great title for a postapocalyptic novel, Sheridan's book is actually a nonfiction guide to preparing yourself for natural disasters and other catastrophes. The author, a Harvard grad who's been an EMT, a merchant marine, and a boxer&#x2014;among many other adventurous endeavors&#x2014;takes us step by step through the process, beginning with the fundamentals: getting physically fit and learning how to handle stress. From there we move, in logical sequence, to more intricate tasks: preparing an emergency disaster kit, learning to protect ourselves in the event of violent encounters (hand-to-hand combat training; learning how to fire a gun), acquiring basic medical skills, planning a strategy to get out of the disaster area, and so on. But this is no mere guide to surviving disaster; it's also the author's personal account of learning to prepare for catastrophe. Sheridan doesn't merely recommend; he shows by example, describing his own experiences while taking the Wilderness EMT program. <b>A clever and very useful guide to getting ready to face the unknown</b>."<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"With a funky sense of humor blended with straight-faced common sense, [Sheridan] not only addresses the long-term psychological trauma of disaster but adds the importance of learning basic first-aid techniques, firearms training, knife skills, hunting and living in the wild, and expertise behind the wheel for a real world escape and survival. As a quirky survivalist primer, Sheridan's work spells out how to stay alive when the world goes topsy-turvy."<br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Sam Sheridan seems to have a tough time sleeping&#x2014;and we are all the better for it. He has taken his recurring nightmares about a zombie apocalypse in L.A.&#x2014;rendered in grippingly real, heart-pounding scenes of narrow escape throughout&#x2014;and turned them into inspiration for a real-life end-of-the-world practical survival guide, as he seeks out expert instruction in knife fighting, gun battle, hot-wiring a car, making an igloo, caring for the sick in a world without hospitals. <b><i>The Disaster Diaries </i>is the book you want in your basement with the batteries and water, a must-have if the world outside ever starts to look like <i>The Road</i></b>."<br>&#x2014;Kevin Conley, author of <i>Stud: Adventures in Breeding </i>and <i>Full Burn: On the Set, at the Bar, Behind the Wheel, and Over the Edge with Hollywood Stuntmen</i><br><br>"Framed by far-out fictional vignettes like zombie infestation and alien invasions, <i>The Disaster Diaries </i>traces a real-world escape path, exploring survival skills from stunt driving a car out of harm's way to dealing with long-term psychological trauma. Sheridan's matter-of-fact tone is informational and gripping, and he never descends into a paranoid, 'us or them' tone. <b>Ultimately, learning to live through an apocalypse is about learning to be a human being; it takes an appetite for knowledge, the ability to cooperate, and most of all, adaptability.</b> Anyone who thinks humankind is getting soft should read this book&#x2014;no matter what happens, it's clear that some of us will survive."<br>&#x2014;Daniel Wilson, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Amped, Robopocalypse</i>, and <i>How to Survive a Robot Uprising</i></p><h2>Sabriel (Old Kingdom)</h2><p><p><em>Game of Thrones</em> fans will love the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Abhorsen series. <em>Sabriel</em>, the first installment in the trilogy, launched critically acclaimed author Garth Nix onto the fantasy scene as a rising star.</p><p>Since childhood, Sabriel has lived outside the walls of the Old Kingdom, away from the power of Free Magic, and away from the Dead who refuse to stay dead. But now her father, the Abhorson, is missing, and Sabriel must cross into that world to find him. With Mogget, whose feline form hides a powerful, perhaps malevolent spirit, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage, Sabriel travels deep into the Old Kingdom. There she confronts an evil that threatens much more than her life and comes face-to-face with her own hidden destiny. . . .</p></p><p>After receiving a cryptic message from her father, Abhorsen, a necromancer trapped in Death, 18-year-old Sabriel sets off into the Old Kingdom. Fraught with peril and deadly trickery, her journey takes her to a world filled with parasitical spirits, Mordicants, and Shadow Hands. Unlike other necromancers, who raise the dead, Abhorsen lays the disturbed dead back to rest. This obliges him--and now Sabriel, who has taken on her father's title and duties--to slip over the border into the icy river of Death, sometimes battling the evil forces that lurk there, waiting for an opportunity to escape into the realm of the living. Desperate to find her father, and grimly determined to help save the Old Kingdom from destruction by the horrible forces of the evil undead, Sabriel endures almost impossible exhaustion, violent confrontations, and terrifying challenges to her supernatural abilities--and her destiny. <p> Garth Nix delves deep into the mystical underworld of necromancy, magic, and the monstrous undead. This tale is not for the faint of heart; imbedded in the classic good-versus-evil story line are subplots of grisly ghouls hungry for human life to perpetuate their stay in the world of the living, and dark, devastating secrets of betrayal and loss. Just <i>try</i> to put this book down. For more along this line, try Nix's later novel: <i>Shade's Children</i>. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p>Sent to a boarding school in Ancelstierre as a young child, Sabriel has had little experience with the random power of Free Magic or the Dead who refuse to stay dead in the Old Kingdom. But during her final semester, her father, the Abhorsen, goes missing, and Sabriel knows she must enter the Old Kingdom to find him. She soon finds companions in Mogget, a cat whose aloof manner barely conceals its malevolent spirit, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage long imprisoned by magic, now free in body but still trapped by painful memories. As the three travel deep into the Old Kingdom, threats mount on all sides. And every step brings them closer to a battle that will pit them against the true forces of life and death&#x2014;and bring Sabriel face-to-face with her own destiny. </p><p>With <em>Sabriel</em>, the first installment in the Abhorsen trilogy, Garth Nix exploded onto the fantasy scene as a rising star, in a novel that takes readers to a world where the line between the living and the dead isn't always clear&#x2014;and sometimes disappears altogether.</p></p><h2>Chinese Children&#39;s Favorite Stories</h2><p><i>Chinese Children's Favorite Stories</i> is a delightful selection of thirteen Chinese folktales as told by author-illustrator Mingmei Yip.

In her introduction, Yip fondly acknowledges her father's role as family storyteller as the inspiration for this book. Some stories will be familiar, such as "The Mouse Bride," though this version is a little different from Lida Dijkstra's <i>Little Mouse</i> (Front St, 2004) and Ed Young's <i>Mouse Match</i> (Harcourt, 1997). Other selections include traditional Chinese elements such as dragons and the mischievous monkey king.

Even so, writes historian T.M. Devine, it was a colony that proudly refused to consider itself anything other than a separate nation, one that bound itself to historical fact and invented traditions alike in an effort to retain national identity. Scotland, Devine writes, fell to England for many reasons, not least of them its small and scattered population. Keenly aware of its status as a subject nation, Scotland still contributed greatly, and disproportionately, to the development of the British Empire--not only by sending its Highland regiments off to battle in distant lands and its people to colonize large parts of the world, but also by committing itself to industrial and technological development, a contribution that created great commercial fortunes in Edinburgh and London alike.<p> Devine charts the uneasy relationship between Scotland and England, focusing closely on the growth of Scottish ideas of independence and self-rule through the last three centuries. Those ideas, he notes with satisfaction, led in July 1999 to the meeting of the first Scottish parliament since 1707. His epic, forward-looking historical study is without peer, and students of Scotland's past and present will find much of value in its pages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>T. M.

In poor health, Bramble sees the world as one of degeneracy and raucous overcrowding, and will not hesitate to let his companions know his feelings on the matter. Peopled with pimps, drunkards, decadents and con-men, Humphrey Clinker displays Smollett&#x2019;s ferociously pessimistic view of mankind, and his belief that the luxury of eighteenth-century England existence was the enemy of sense and sobriety. Presented in the form of letters from six very different characters, and full of joyful puns and double entendres, Humphrey Clinker is now recognised as a boisterous and observant masterpiece of English satire. Jeremy Lewis&#x2019;s introduction examines why Smollett has become an unjustly neglected figure of English literature, and how the time in which he lived became a crucible for his work.

He was educated at local schools and then at the University of Glasgow, which he left without a degree. He was apprenticed as a surgeon in the city, but in 1739 went to London. In 1740 he sailed with the fleet to the West Indies as surgeon's mate on HMS Chichester. He was present at the disastrous attack on Cartagena and cisited Jamaica. He settled in London in 1744 and practised&#x2014;unsuccessfully&#x2014;as a surgeon. <i>The Adventures of Roderick Random</i>, Smollett's first novel, appeared in 1748. Drawing on his own experiences, the book is a series of adventures depicting the travels of a Scottish hero; its expose of London life foreshadows some of the themes in <i>Humphry Clinker</i>. Smollett's last years were parred by sickness and disappointment. In 1760 he was fined �100 and sentenced to three months' imprisonment for a bitter attack on Admiral Knowles (who had commanded the West Indies expedition) in the <i>Critical Review</i>, which with two others he had founded in 1756 and edited until 1762. He then edited,with little success, <i>The Briton</i>, a weekly periodical supporting the unpopular Scottish Prime Minister, Lord Bute. Ill-health sent him abroad in 1763, and in 1766 he published his entertaining and acerbic <i>Travels in France and Italy</i>, which earned him, from Sterne, the nickname of "Smelfungus." He returned for a last visit to Scotland and Bath and then finally left England in 1768, dying aged fifty at Monte Nero, near Leghorn. <i>Humphry Clinker</i> was published in the year of his death, 1771.<br><br><b> JEREMY LEWIS </b>worked in publishing for much of his life after leaving Trinity College, Dublin, in 1965, and was a director of Chatto &amp; Windus for ten years.

People are angry at governments that spend more but deliver less, frustrated with bureaucracies that give them no control, and tired of politicians who raise taxes and cut services but fail to solve the problems we face. <i>Reinventing Government</i> is both a call to arms in the revolt against bureaucratic malaise and a guide to those who want to build something better. It shows that there is a third way: that the options are not simply liberal or conservative, but that our systems of governance can be fundamentally reframed; that a caring government can still function as efficiently and productively as the best-run businesses.Authors Osborne and Gaebler describe school districts that have used choice, empowerment, and competition to quadruple their students' performance; sanitation departments that have cut their costs in half and now beat the private sector in head-to-head competition; military commands that have slashed red tape, decentralized authority, and doubled the effectiveness of their troops. They describe a fundamental reinvention of government already underway&#x2014;in part beneath the bright lights of Capitol Hill, but more often in the states and cities and school districts of America, where the real work of government goes on.From Phoenix to St. Paul, Washington, D.C. to Washington state, entrepreneurial public managers have discarded budget systems that encourage managers to waste money, scrapped civil service systems developed for the nineteenth century, and jettisoned bureaucracies built for the 1930s. They have replaced these industrial-age systems with more decentralized, more entrepreneurial, more responsive organizations designed for the rapidly changing, information-rich world of the 1990s.Osborne and Gaebler isolate and describe ten principles around which entrepreneurial public organizations are built. They:1) steer more than they row2) empower communities rather than simply deliver services3) encourage competition rather than monopoly4) are driven by their missions, not their rules5) fund outcomes rather than inputs6) meet the needs of the customer, not the bureaucracy7) concentrate on earning, not just spending8) invest in prevention rather than cure9) decentralize authority10) solve problems by leveraging the marketplace, rather than simple creating public programs. <i>Reinventing Government</i> is not a partisan book. It focuses not on what government should do, but on how government should work. As such, it has been embraced by both liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans.</p><p><b>David Osborne,</b> author of <i>Laboratories of Democracy, </i> is a frequent contributor to the <i>Washington Post, Governing,</i> and other publications. He is also a consultant to state and local governments.<b>Ted Gaebler,</b> former city manager of Visalia, California, and Vandalia, Ohio, is president of the Gaebler Group, a division of MRC, a public-sector management-consulting firm, in San Rafael, California. <b>David Osborne,</b> author of <i>Laboratories of Democracy, </i> is a frequent contributor to the <i>Washington Post, Governing,</i> and other publications. He is also a consultant to state and local governments.<b>Ted Gaebler,</b> former city manager of Visalia, California, and Vandalia, Ohio, is president of the Gaebler Group, a division of MRC, a public-sector management-consulting firm, in San Rafael, California.An inspiring, well-organized exposition of ten principles that appear to offer hope for renewal in an era of government decline. Osborne's Laboratories of Democracy (1988) celebrated government innovation at state and local levels; here, the ideas are further developed, with many more examples and a sharper focus. Osborne and Gaebler (the former city manager of Visalia, California) charge that government bureaucracy, created a hundred years ago to combat official corruption, has outlived its usefulness. Since governments are increasingly caught between declining revenues and rising demands for service, the authors call on them to become more ``catalytic,'' ``mission-driven,'' ``customer-driven,'' ``anticipatory,'' ``market-oriented,'' etc. The authors recognize that these terms may have a vaguely threatening ring to many liberals and public employees, but they counter those fears with examples of how the adoption of these principles has resulted in employee empowerment, increased public support, etc. For example, they explain how, when Phoenix forced its trash collectors to compete with private businesses while guaranteeing the collectors' jobs, morale and productivity soared. Most convincing is the way Osborne and Gaebler discuss honestly the most serious potential problems with their proposals--e.g., their refusal to endorse merit pay for individual teachers, which, they admit, may set up cutthroat situations. Analyzing the successful experiments, they provide theory for political scientists to chew on and examples for government officials to consider--e.g., that of Visalia, which uses bonuses to reward groups of employees more often than individuals ``on the theory that individual rewards encourage people to hoard information and compete with one another, while group rewards encourage people to share information and work together.''

As an exposition of encouragement and exhortation, Hebrews addresses the central concerns of our contemporary church as well: the felt absence of God, a climate of uncertainty and insecurity, the tension between secular conformity and spiritual maturity and the treat of societal perversion and materialism to a Christian commitment. Christians are called upon to express a faith that is rooted in the future and to continue this life of pilgrimage with a radical new view of reality, which is based on sure confidence in the intervention of God in daily life. Tracing the writer&#39;s development thought by thought, rather than verse by verse, careful attention is paid to the cultural and historical background.

Griffin's police procedural, Josef Sommer sounds as if he's gargling with rocks. Fortunately, Sommer gets stronger the longer he talks. His versatility remains limited-he never, for example, makes one believe that he's any of Griffin's women characters-but he has a knack for punctuating the drama of a moment, which well serves Griffin's dense prose style. While the author conjures up a world of crime and punishment that makes Dostoevsky look positively minimalist, Sommer is always there to soothingly guide us back to the essentials of character and plot.

(Oct.)</p><h2>Toward the Flame: A Memoir of World War I</h2><p>Considered by many to be the finest American combat memoir of the First World War, Hervey Allen&#x2019;s <i>Toward the Flame</i> vividly chronicles the experiences of the Twenty-eighth Division in the summer of 1918. Made up primarily of Pennsylvania National Guardsmen, the Twenty-eighth Division saw extensive action on the Western Front. The story begins with Lieutenant Allen and his men marching inland from the French coast and ends with their participation in the disastrous battle for the village of Fismette. Allen was a talented observer, and the men with whom he served emerge as well-rounded characters against the horrific backdrop of the war.&nbsp;As a historical document, <i>Toward the Flame</i> is significant for its highly detailed account of the controversial military action at Fismette. At the same time, it easily stands as a work of literature. Clear-eyed and unsentimental, Allen employs the novelist&#x2019;s powers of description to create a harrowing portrait of coalition war at its worst.</p><p>Hervey Allen was the author of many volumes of poetry and prose, including the popular novel <i>Anthony Adverse</i>. Steven Trout is an associate professor of English at Fort Hays State University. He is the author of <i>Memorial Fictions: Willa Cather and the First World War</i> (Nebraska 2002) and a coeditor of <i>Literature of the Great War Reconsidered: Beyond Modern Memory.</i>"This work has been considered by many to be the finest American frontline memoir to come out of World War I.

Traditionally, medical science has thought of it as an invasive tumor arising spontaneously in an otherwise healthy organism. In contrast, Wilhelm Reich defines cancer not as a tumor--the tumor is merely a late manifestation of the disease--but a systemic disease due to chronic thwaring of natural sexual functioning. In this radically different scientific investigation of a process that ends, literally, in the putrefaction of the living body due to chronic suffocatin of the tissues, Reich has arrived at the conclusion that "cancer is the most significant somatic expression of biophysiological effect of sexual stasis." If this is so, there is a far greater possibility for prevention of cancer than for its treatment.</p><p><i>The Cancer Biopathy</i> is Volume II of<i> The Discovery of the Orgone</i>.

Here are fascinating insights, based on Pernoud's sound knowledge and extensive experience as an archivist at the French National Archives. The book will be provocative for the general readers as well as a helpful resource for teachers.<p>Scorned for centuries, although lauded by the Romantics, these thousand years of history have most often been concealed behind the dark clouds of ignorance: Why, didn't&nbsp;<i>godiche</i>&nbsp;(clumsy, oafish) come from&nbsp;<i>gothique</i>&nbsp;(Gothic)?

Working as a writer and an endangered-species biologist, he became convinced that returning grass-fed, free-roaming buffalo to the grasslands of the northern plains would return natural balance to the region and reestablish the undulating prairie lost through poor land management and overzealous farming. In 1998 he bought his first buffalo and began the task of converting a little cattle ranch into an ethically run buffalo ranch.<br>&nbsp;<i>Wild Idea</i> is a book about how good food choices can influence federal policies and the integrity of our food system, and about the dignity and strength of a legendary American animal. It is also a book about people: the daughter coming to womanhood in a hard landscape, the friend and ranch hand who suffers great tragedy, the venture capitalist who sees hope and opportunity in a struggling buffalo business, and the husband&nbsp;and wife behind the ranch who struggle daily, wondering if what they are doing will ever be enough to make a difference. At its center, <i>Wild Idea</i> is about a family and the people and animals that surround them&#x2014;all trying to build a healthy life in a big, beautiful, and sometimes dangerous land.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><p>Dan O&#x2019;Brien is the author of numerous novels and memoirs, including <i>Buffalo for the Broken Heart: Restoring Life to a Black Hills Ranch</i>, winner of the Western Heritage Award for best nonfiction.

We as Christians come to know the fullness of the Godhead through the love, the grace and the communion, which proceed from the triune God. It is the love of God the Father that purposes all. It is the grace of God the Son that provides all. And it is the communion of God the Spirit that performs all. Love, grace and communion are all equally essential. What would love be without grace? It would have no expression. What would grace be without communion? It would be unattainable. This present volume is a compilation of messages given by God&#39;s servant Watchman Nee at various times and places. They all relate to the communion of the Holy Spirit. The first part consists of two messages on Resurrection, the Holy Spirit, and the Church. A proper perspective on the marvelous work of the Holy Spirit is therein given. The second part, entitled &#34;The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit,&#34; is composed of six messages on the Outpouring, one message on the Holy Spirit, and the Law, and two messages on the Anointing Oil. And the third part presents four messages on Spiritual Judgment, which is the fruit of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Such discipline gives spiritual discernment for service. May the blessed Lord who released these messages to the Church use them for the building up of the body of Christ in love.</p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Whispering the Word: Hearing Women&#39;s Stories in the Old Testament</h2><p><p>Many Christian feminists wonder if they can simultaneously maintain their commitment to principles of gender equality and their faith in the Scriptures, particularly the Old Testament. Writing in response to feminist biblical scholars who approach the Old Testament with a hermeneutic of suspicion, Jacqueline Lapsley offers Christian feminists strategies to hear the subtle ideas and voices of the less powerful within the Old Testament texts. Reading and interpreting a number of Old Testament narratives in which women are prominent, Lapsley considers how these stories may reflect God's word for us. In doing so, she demonstrates how the narrative often attempts to shape the moral response of the reader by revealing the intricacy and complexity of the moral world evoked. In this gentle shaping of the reader's ethical sensibilities, she argues, is where God may be whispering a word for us.</p></p><p>"Rich, perceptive, and persuasive. Lapsley&#x2019;s keen intelligence, discerning insight, and elegant style make this a delightful book to read. In her hands even the most familiar and often discussed narratives disclose new dimensions of meaning. In Whispering the Word Lapsley models the very best of biblical literary hermeneutics." &#x2014;Carol Newsom, Charles Howard Candler Professor of Old Testament, Candler School of Theology, Emory University <p> "Elegant, significant, and needed. I read it with hunger, for Lapsley&#x2019;s work slips into the seemingly unbridgeable divide between feminists in academy and church. Just when I thought there was little left to say about the women and the Old Testament, I find new theological doors open and feminist interpretation newly sophisticated." &#x2014;Kathleen M. O&#x2019;Connor, William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament, Columbia Theological Seminary </p><p>"Lapsley not only reads Scripture in a sensitive fashion that brings the ancient text and contemporary concerns into critical dialogue with each other, but she lays the groundwork for a new model of Christian-feminist biblical scholarship that is both critically informed and theologically insightful. She explains complex material in an accessible fashion that makes this book a pleasure to read as well ensuring it a place in many classrooms." &#x2014;Joel S. Kaminsky, Associate Professor in the Department of Religion and Biblical Literature, Smith College </p><p>"Lapsley has provided us with a &#x2018;hermeneutics of whispering&#x2019; in this book: gentle but insistent; respectful but critical; ethical, courageous, compassionate. She helps us catch the polyphony and echo which characterize these biblical voices and would catch our attention, and she brings a feminist critique to the challenge of reading Scripture productively in our time." &#x2014;Barbara Green, Professor of Biblical Studies, Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, Graduate Theological Union </p><p>"Jacqueline Lapsley pays close attention to narrative detail, but she also pays close attention to readers&#x2014;both ancient and contemporary&#x2014;and how their predispositions and social contexts affect the hearing of the text. Her own readings are subtle, yet so clearly presented that readers will be drawn into the drama of these stories and led more deeply into biblical narrative as a whole." &#x2014;Ellen F.

It is unique in that it provides insight into the Aramaic language and Semitic customs of almost two thousand years ago. If you instinctively shy away from "commentaries"&#x2014;This one will surprise you. No dull theological seminary textbook, the approach is simple, informative, and scholarly, without using specialized theological terminology. This inimitable commentary acts a Near Eastern guide, revealing to the Western mind a more intimate picture of the socio-religious and psychological environment of the period. It offers an understanding of the character and behavior of Near Eastern Semites. This is the field of Dr. Errico's and Dr. Lamsa's research and expertise. They bring clarification to many misunderstood passages and sayings of Jesus. Learn the Semitic meanings behind such terms as "the Word," "Light," "Life," "Christ." Understand what Jesus meant when he said "No man comes to the Father except through me" and many other sayings that appear to be sectarian and exclusive. This volume is more than a revision of Dr. Lamsa's commentaries, Gospel Light, 1936, and More Light on the Gospel, 1968. Dr. Errico has edited, expanded and annotated these previous works in the new format that Dr. Lamsa desired. In addition, this book contains unpublished material that the two of them outlined just before Dr. Lamsa died in 1975. Dr. Errico completed these comments and has added information derived from his continual research in Near Eastern Semitic studies.</p><p>DR. ROCCO A. ERRICO, Ph.D., D.D., is an ordained minister, author and lecturer and one of the nations's leading biblical scholars working from the original Aramaic texts. Dr. Errico is the recipient of numerous awards and academic degrees, including a doctorate in Letters from the College of Seminarians, The Apostolic Succession of Antioch and the Church of the East&#x2014;American See, a doctorate in Divinity from St. Ephrem's Institute in Sweden, and a doctorate in Philosophy from the School of Christianity in Los Angeles. For ten years he studied intensively with Dr. George M. Lamsa, world-renowned native Assyrian scholar of the Scriptures. In 1970 Dr. Errico established the Noohra Foundation, which is dedicated to helping people of all faiths to understand the Near Eastern background and Aramaic interpretation of the Bible. GEORGE M. LAMSA, Th.D. (1892-1975) was born in a civilization with customs, manners and language almost identical to those in the time of Jesus. His native tongue was full of similar idioms and parables, untouched by the outside world in 1900 years. Dr. Lamsa's formal education began under the priests and deacons of the ancient Church of the East and he later graduated with the highest honors ever bestowed from the Archbishop of Canterbury's Colleges in Iran and Turkey. After arriving in the United States, he devoted his life to translating the Holy Bible from the Ancient Eastern Text and also authored numerous biblical commentaries.</p><h2>Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times</h2><p>Dracula, Prince of Many Faces reveals the extraordinary life and times of the infamous Vlad Dracula of Romania (1431 - 1476), nicknamed the Impaler. Dreaded by his enemies, emulated by later rulers like Ivan the Terrible, honored by his countrymen even today, Vlad Dracula was surely one of the most intriguing figures to have stalked the corridors of European and Asian capitals in the fifteenth century.</p><p>Radu R. Florescu and Raymond T. McNally are the authors of the international bestseller, IN SEARCH OF DRACULA and have long been recognised as the leading experts on Dracula and Eastern European history and folklore. Raymond T. McNallyDracula is the third book that Florescu and McNally, both historians at Boston College, have written about either the real Dracula or the legendary vampire ( Dracula: A Historical Biography of the Impaler, 1431-1476 , Hawthorn, 1973; LJ 2/1/74). This scholarly work focuses almost exclusively upon the "real" Dracula, a 15th-century Romanian prince. The authors present him as a multifaceted figure, a national hero still revered for defending Romania from the Turks, yet also a psychopath who used his power indiscriminately to torture and murder thousands of his enemies and subjects. Because of the constant interest in the occult (especially in the vampire Dracula), public libraries will want this for popular collections. Because of its sound treatment of an important figure in Eastern European history, academic libraries also should consider.<br><i>- Ann H. Sullivan, Tompkins Cortland Community Coll.

But can he protect her from the dangers of her own heart?</p><p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b> is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling <b>Heralds Of Valdemar</b> series. She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator. She lives in Oklahoma with her husband, artist Larry Dixon, and their flock of parrots. She can be found at mercedeslackey.com.Making love and not war is the theme of Lackey's entertaining high fantasy, the second in a trilogy (after 2002's Exile's Honor) within her long-running Valdemar series-not that love is any less of a battlefield. Alberich of Karse, the outsider Herald, must watch over the newly enthroned queen, Selenay, as he trains young Heralds by day and chases down treasonous plots in the alleys and shady locales of Haven by night. Along the way, his recruit in the arts of undercover work, Herald-Chronicler-Second Myste, provides him with her own ideas of work under covers. And his Companion, the intelligent, mind-linked equine Kantor, keeps Alberich honest with a sardonic sense of humor. The recently bereaved Selenay, too, faces her own challenge in the court of love, first from anxious councilors trying to arrange a royal marriage, then from the too-good-to-be-true Prince Karathanelan of Rethwellan. Will good triumph in the end? That answer will have to wait for the next book, as the master villain remains unknown. But it would take a poor gambler to bet against a set of characters so obviously beloved by their author, despite her inflicting a Germanic speech pattern on poor Alberich, who often sounds like Yoda. Long-time readers will appreciate learning more of favorite characters. Newcomers will definitely feel as though they have walked in on the middle of a gossipy conversation. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>F&amp;W Media Interweave Press, Brioche Chic</h2><p>F&amp;W Media-Interweave Press: Brioche Chic.

For centuries, from the pre-Columbian era through the 1840s, Native Americans took prisoners of war and killed, adopted, or enslaved them. Christina Snyder's pathbreaking book takes a familiar setting for bondage, the American South, and places Native Americans at the center of her engrossing story. <br><br>Indian warriors captured a wide range of enemies, including Africans, Europeans, and other Indians. Yet until the late eighteenth century, age and gender more than race affected the fate of captives. As economic and political crises mounted, however, Indians began to racialize slavery and target African Americans. Native people struggling to secure a separate space for themselves in America developed a shared language of race with white settlers. Although the Indians' captivity practices remained fluid long after their neighbors hardened racial lines, the Second Seminole War ultimately tore apart the inclusive communities that Native people had created through centuries of captivity.<br><br>Snyder's rich and sweeping history of Indian slavery connects figures like Andrew Jackson and Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe with little-known captives like Antonia Bonnelli, a white teenager from Spanish Florida, and David George, a black runaway from Virginia. Placing the experiences of these individuals within a complex system of captivity and Indians' relations with other peoples, Snyder demonstrates the profound role of Native American history in the American past.</p><p>Christina Snyder is Assistant Professor of American Studies and History at Indiana University.&#x201c;Until Christina Snyder, no historian has told the story of the constantly evolving Native American tradition of enslavement that long pre-dated the arrival of Europeans and of Africans. Compellingly written and deeply researched, <i>Slavery in Indian Country</i> is a model of how foregrounding Native experiences can transform our understanding of American history. The "Slave South" will never look quite the same again.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel K. Richter, McNeil Center for Early American Studies, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br>&#x201c;Snyder illuminates a world where slavery and survival went hand-in-hand, an era when native people were both masters and slaves, and a culture that only gradually learned to define slaves by the color of their skin. Her narrative sweep, unflinching analysis, and astonishing research make this a disturbing and powerful book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Rothman, Georgetown University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Snyder skillfully explores Indian captive-taking, associated with warfare from the dawn of time, and its evolution and adaptation to new conditions after Europeans and Africans arrived and captivity was transformed into race-based slavery. Beautifully written, this is Indian and Southern history at its best.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kathryn Braund, author of <i>Deerskins and Duffels: The Creek Indian Trade with Anglo-America, 1685-1815</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Deeply researched, authoritative, and indispensable, <i>Slavery in Indian Country</i> tells us how slavery as an institution changed from a kin-based to a race-based system and richly evokes what the experience of slavery meant to those who were enslaved.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nancy Shoemaker, University of Connecticut</b><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating new perspective on slavery in the American South, especially valuable for understanding slavery's great variability and change over time, and for offering new insight into race and race-making.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Kolchin, author of <i>American Slavery</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Snyder...explores the Indian practice of enslaving prisoners of war in this instructive and remarkably readable book...She reaches back to early Indian captivity practices&#x2015;and how conceptions of captives and their roles in Indian communities changed with the arrival of Europeans and Africans. During the colonial period, captives were chosen on the basis of gender and age, not race, but as a nativist movement ("a collective identity as red people") emerged in the late-18th century, Americans, black and white, became the "common enemy." By the early 19th century--when, among other factors, black slaves became more highly valued--Africans were specifically targeted. Snyder breaks new ground in this study [and] reveals pre-colonial Southern history and restores visibility to Native American history in the region.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Snyder] focuses on the evolution of slavery from the perspective of individual Native American groups. She demonstrates that captivity, before the arrival of Europeans, played an important role in Native societies, as some captives became kinfolk while others became slaves...Highly recommended.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Burch</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b></p><h2>The Intentional Legacy</h2><p>Will your children value their legacy? The history of the world is the story of great financial, cultural and ethical legacies built in one generation, only to be squandered by second and third generations who were unwilling and unprepared for the roles and responsibilities that accompany them. It is a problem that troubles wealth managers, social theorists, and, of course, parents. Solving the problem requires intentionality--the process of careful thought and preparation concerning the most critical details that will shape your family and its future. To be intentional is to decide that you will be self-conscious about the way you live your life and shape the legacy you hope to bequeath to the next generations. In The Intentional Legacy, David McAlvany brings a fresh perspective to this old subject. Drawing from more than fifty years of experience in a multigenerational wealth management firm, as well as his own personal failures and successes, David presents a strategy for reverse engineering your life. Most importantly, he presents an redemptive ethic for family prosperity based on love, forgiveness, and non-contingent relationships.</p><p>David McAlvany is CEO of the McAlvany Financial Companies International Collectors Associates, ICA Europe, and McAlvany Wealth Management. He is a featured speaker on national television programs including CNBC, Fox News, Fox Business News, and Bloomberg; on radio programs; and at financial seminars around the world, analyzing major events and their impact on the global economy and financial markets. He can be heard weekly on his market commentary with world leaders, bankers, economists, and renowned investors.Far too often the pursuit of money takes priority over relationships, leaving children, coworkers, and employees spiritually, intellectually, and morally bankrupt. This book reveals the legacy treasures that will inspire readers to find ultimate purpose and value in life. McAlvany s insights and solutions to holistic, generational planning make this book a gem! He is transparent and generous in sharing personal experiences as well as professional expertise to deliver a heart warming and practical guide to being intentional about blessing our families far beyond passing along assets. --Chuck Bentley | CEO, Crown Financial Ministries<br><br>For thirty years I've known the McAlvany family and rarely is a legacy passed, so seamlessly, from one generation to the next. --Dr. Chuck Missler | Author and Founder of Koinonia House<br><br>McAlvany reminds readers that we both receive and pass on a legacy to others. None of us do it perfectly. We are awkward and broken and therefore need the wise advice and counsel that this book provides. In fact, David, who has learned well, through careful attention and thoughtful reflection, makes reading about wisdom a pleasurable experience. Every page of the book has something memorable, and often quotable. Well written, and profound, all who are serious about living intentionally and leaving in their wake a legacy to benefit those who follow should make this book a must read! --Professor Jerry Root, Ph.D. | Wheaton College</p><h2>An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru</h2><p><p>Available in English for the first time, <i>An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru</i> is a firsthand account of the Spanish invasion, narrated in 1570 by Diego de Castro Titu Cusi Yupanqui - the penultimate ruler of the Inca dynasty - to a Spanish missionary and transcribed by a mestizo assistant. The resulting hybrid document offers an Inca perspective on the Spanish conquest of Peru, filtered through the monk and his scribe. </p><p>Titu Cusi tells of his father's maltreatment at the hands of the conquerors; his father's ensuing military campaigns, withdrawal, and murder; and his own succession as ruler. Although he continued to resist Spanish attempts at "pacification," Titu Cusi entertained Spanish missionaries, converted to Christianity, and then, most importantly, narrated his story of the conquest to enlighten Emperor Phillip II about the behavior of the emperor's subjects in Peru. This vivid narrative illuminates the Incan view of the Spanish invaders and offers an important account of indigenous resistance, accommodation, change, and survival in the face of the European conquest.</p> <p>Informed by literary, historical, and anthropological scholarship, Bauer's introduction points out the hybrid elements of Titu Cusi's account, revealing how it merges native Andean and Spanish rhetorical and cultural practices.

Bauer's scholarship, and his mastery of the topic, is reflected in the fine translation as well as in the extensive introduction and substantial set of footnotes. The translation is not only highly accurate, but also modernized in a way that will make the account easily accessible to specialists, students of Latin American history, as well as the general public interested in the Incas. The introduction provides information on the specific social conditions under which the document was written and insights into the historical personages mentioned in the text. . . .

The account will help students and teachers of Latin American history and historians in general better understand the complex and incomplete process of the Spanish Conquest in Peru. Titu Cusi's text and Bauer's ample introduction confront readers with the significant divisions, competing factions, and surprising alliances that appeared among both Inca nobles and Spanish invaders as they battled for power and wealth in the Andes."<br><b>&#x2015;<i>The Americas</i></b><br><br>"This translation, available for the first time in its entirety, takes a critical look at how the Incan society challenged the Spanish conquest."<br> &#x2015;<i>Colorado Endowment for the Humanities 2005 Publication Prize Committee</i></p><h2>How Diablo Became Spirit (Conscious Stories)</h2><p>2018 GOLD WINNER, Book Series, 21st Annual COVR Visionary Awards; SILVER WINNER, Moonbeam Childrens Book Awards, Best Childrens Book Series.

They'd read about it on their computer screens or in the newspaper; they'd find out on their way to work or over morning coffee, listening to the radio or watching television. The news would be shouted into their cell phones or overheard on the train. They'd talk about it at the watercooler and on coffee breaks. There'd be group e-mails, message-board postings, hastily scribbled notes. They'd call grandchildren, and grandparents, to share and discuss.</p><p>The news would race around an electronic ribbon in Times Square and on billboards in London and news tickers all over the world. It would break into regular broadcasts and be teased on the morning shows. It would be whispered behind cupped hands in classrooms and screamed across playgrounds. Some would laugh and others would cry, but all would be affected. The news would skitter at light speed, unstoppable, through land lines and fiber-optic cables and over airwaves until it reached workplaces and houses and playgrounds, multiplying until it could weave itself into a blanket and cover the world.</p><p>I was barely conscious when I found out. I was on my bed, fully dressed, lying on my stomach and trying to keep my head from lolling right onto the keys of my laptop. When my phone rang, my head hit the keys like a dropped melon. I groaned and rubbed the new indentations on my nose while fumbling for the Talk button.</p><p>"Whagugh?"<i></i></p><p><i>"It's up!"</i></p><p>It was Sue Upton shrieking at me, and I let the phone fall so I could use my remaining free hand to rub what now felt like a punctured eardrum. At this rate I'd end up comatose before breakfast.</p><p>Sue was still yelling, the sound muffled from the dropped phone, but now completely unnecessary. Clarity broke upon me and I knew exactly what she was yelling about. It was why I was lying next to my keyboard, the reason I had been awake in the first place. The last few hours replayed themselves in my mind in a blink. Barely 10:00 p.m., sitting at my friend Julie's house, watching television after a light news day, chatting during commercials. Reaching for my cell phone out of unbreakable habit, as natural a motion as blinking. Tapping my Web browser, waiting for my e-mail to load, all without interrupting the flow of conversation -- in fact, barely showing I was holding a phone at all. Flicking my eyes down to the screen, just to check that everything was all right online while I was away from a computer. No important e-mails, good. No emergencies, no broken servers, good. Pausing. One, two, three, four e-mails. Four of the fifty e-mails I'd received over the past hour were eerily alike and seemed to come from different parts of the country with the same news -- like witnesses who chose the same man from a police lineup.</p><p>"I work in a bookstore and we just got an e-mail from Scholastic..."</p><p>"...it said something big is coming..."</p><p>"...said it's what we've been waiting for...Do you think this is <i>that?</i>"</p><p>I did, but didn't know if I wanted to. It had been such a calm, slow day, for a change, which meant I should have known it would be followed by a crazy parade. Six years on this beat had taught me to shake out the news from the rubbish, and this -- this felt real. This felt like everything had just changed. Those short and simple e-mails had effects on me far disproportionate to their size -- my heart seemed to sneak up into my throat and stick, pounding through me with the same rush I got when I reached the top of a roller coaster -- about to get to the best part, the part I'd been waiting for, but still panicky and unsure I was ready to plummet.</p><p>Julie asked what was wrong but I was already gathering my stuff, making my apologies, telling her to check the Web site the next morning, bowing my way out of the apartment and calling Sue, the site's senior editor.</p><p>"I know," Sue said, instead of "hello." A clear thrill trembled under her words.</p><p>"They look real, Sue," I said. "Is this happening right now?"</p><p>"I think it is!" There it was again, that squeal of happiness threatening to break free. I denied myself my own flourish of giddiness, which was squirming around in my chest. No way. There was an announcement to be made in mere hours, and we'd be helping bring it to millions, and we were not ready, there were things to do and lists of things we had<i> wanted</i> to do and all these things we had planned to do, and now...</p><p>"I have to call John. And D. H. And Nick, and Alex, and Doris, and everyone, and make sure we're going to stay up tomorrow and get a low-bandwidth page ready and get home, and, and...a lot of things."</p><p>Sue made a squeaking sound. She was going to burst. T-minus thirty seconds and counting.</p><p>"See you online at five a.m.? Podcast right after?" I asked. No answer. "Sue?"</p><p>A high-pitched squeal exploded out of the phone and assaulted my eardrums. I held the phone at arm's length. <i>"Oh my God, Melissa it's coming now!"</i></p><p>"Yeah, I think it is," I said, and with that she had infected me. The words wavered as though I'd rattled them, and I danced a little on the spot.</p><p>Five minutes later I was on my way home. I called John on my car phone as I hit the Staten Island Expressway, which was thick with late-January mush. He answered thickly and it sounded like I was distracting him from something more important.</p><p>"So, are you ready for this?" I asked, and told him what I thought was about to happen.</p><p>"Are you <i>kidding</i> me?" John yelled. "Now? Holy -- " and he let loose a stream of obscenities. "That's it? We're on a six-month timer?"</p><p>"Looks like."</p><p>"I'll be damned. What am I going to do with school?" John worked on a trimester basis, which meant he didn't get the same summer breaks as every other student, and the idea that he might not be able to take part in whatever celebrations were going on this summer was already causing a tightness in my chest. "I'm going to need about a month off."</p><p>"We'll work it out," I told him.</p><p>He promised to be awake and alert at 7:00 a.m. to record a podcast, and to stay up afterward to create a countdown for the site, and we hung up. I paused before calling Alex; genius programmer or not, he was in high school, and it was late; I could send him an e-mail when I got home, and he'd be up in time to act on it. Nick would be sleeping; it was nearly 4:00 a.m. his time.</p><p>Out of people to call, I drove in silence, worried for a moment that this was all an elaborate scam. No, it couldn't be -- what would the plan be, to send e-mails from all corners of the country to convince people to wake up early on a specific day, realize there was no news to be had, and go back to bed? That wasn't even a scam, it was a complicated and pointless prank. This had to be real. Scholastic had informed bookstores to be on the alert tomorrow for a huge announcement. And there was no reason for them to do that, except -- </p><p>The phone rang, and I laughed upon seeing the caller ID. It was Paul. Was word spreading so fast inside this community that it had already gotten to the rock stars?</p><p>"Yo, DeGeorge."</p><p>"Yo, Anelli," he said, as always sounding slightly bemused. I waited for him to ask me if the rumors were true. "I've got news."</p><p>"So do I."</p><p>"I'm announcing the EP of the Month Club tomorrow!"</p><p>He might as well have said, "I'm going to the moon tomorrow!" I'd have the same reaction. "<i>Such</i> a bad idea, man."</p><p>"What? Why?!"</p><p>I filled him in. No announcement of any kind in our community would get any play tomorrow except one. Not even if Bruce Springsteen decided to cover Britney Spears for Paul's charity compilation would it get any attention tomorrow. To my surprise, Paul wasn't annoyed -- he just started talking more swiftly than his usual sauntering pace allowed.</p><p>"When do you think it will be? Joe and I are betting on July 31. We're planning our whole tour around it, I've got it all mapped out, we'll be back in Boston for the release. The birthdays, you know?"</p><p>"But that's not a Saturday. They always come out on Saturdays," I offered, then yawned and exited the highway at my stop. "All right. I have to get home and e-mail everyone in the world. Check the site when you get up. If it's even working."</p><p>Helplessness while driving made me twitchy. I thought briefly about calling Cheryl, but that would be pointless; she wouldn't be able to tell me anything anyway, and to press her wouldn't be fair. And besides, she'd just lie. In fact, I realized, laughing grimly, she had lied to me less than a week ago. We'd had dinner and she'd said...Oh, I was going to get her back, and soon.</p><p>There was nothing left to do, not until I got to my computer. I tapped the steering wheel impatiently and tried to obey the speed limit. Tomorrow was it; this frigid final day of January was the last day of sanity, at least for a while. What had started seventeen years ago would now end in six months. After a year and a half of waiting, a year and a half of preparation, a year and a half of knowing that this announcement was only a breath away, I now felt like my own breath had been stolen. For me this journey had lasted seven years, and it had changed me, and now it was time to say good-bye. If I could, I would have put out my hands and pushed back against the oncoming train.</p><p>But morning was coming despite my wishes, so I parked the car in front of my building and dragged myself upstairs to my shoddy apartment. I fired off a storm of e-mails: to programmers, to tell them to be ready to defend our Web site against the onslaught; to our hosting company, to ask them to monitor our bandwidth and give us more when we needed it; to John, to describe what the site countdown should look like; to editors; to all the senior staff; and to friends and family warning them I'd be out of touch. David and Kathleen got texts of warning. I prepared our links and wrote a draft post, and fell asleep with my laptop next to my head.</p><p>At 5:00 a.m. on February 1, Sue was waiting for me, with an IM conversation already flashing on my computer screen. We had, no doubt, overshot our time frame -- announcements usually came at 7:00 a.m. -...</p></p><h2>The Plot Is Murder (Mystery Bookshop)</h2><p><i>The small town of North Harbor on the shores of Lake Michigan is about to have a new mystery bookstore.

The mobsters running the place found themselves juggling rebellious youths alongside celebrities like Greta Garbo and Shirley MacLaine. When The Beatles visited the club, Cami's uncle-in-law had to restrain a hitman who was after Ringo because his girlfriend was so infatuated with the drummer.</p><p>Working with Dick Cami himself, Johnson and Selvin unveil this engrossing story of the go-go sixties and the club that inspired the classic hits "Twisting the Night Away" and "The Peppermint Twist."</p></p><p><p>The son of a steel worker, JOHN JOHNSON, JR. attended Whittier College and UC Riverside.

Cami later was an acclaimed restaurateur in South Florida, where he entertained high-ranking mafiosi, FBI agents, athletes and show business celebrities.</p><i>Chapter 1</i> <br> <br>Ground Zero <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Dick Cami was lounging by the pool at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach mid-October 1961 when he got the call from New York. Something about celebrities, socialites, and other A-listers crowding into the off-Broadway dive that his father-in-law and his boys owned on West 45th Street. <br>The teen dance club didn&#x2019;t have a phone. The boys were smart enough not to have one because that way it couldn&#x2019;t be tapped. When Dick called back, he had to dial a pay phone that rang in the Knickerbocker Hotel lobby, which was right outside the club&#x2019;s back door. He was not surprised to hear a flirtatious woman&#x2019;s voice come on the line. The Knickerbocker these days rented as many rooms by the hour as they did to the luckless out-of-towners, the unemployed, and those only a week away from living on the streets. <br>&#x201c;Hi, honey,&#x201d; Cami said. &#x201c;Do me a favor and stick your head in the door behind you, the one to the Peppermint Lounge, and ask for Louie or Sam.&#x201d; <br>The girl hesitated. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a big guy blocking the door.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tell him to come to the phone&#x2014;please.&#x201d; <br>A moment later, the gruff voice of the Terrible Turk came on the line. <br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Turk, it&#x2019;s me, Dick.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dickie, holy shit, you can&#x2019;t believe what&#x2019;s happening here.&#x201d; <br>The Turk was a former professional wrestler with a shaved head and a body that looked like it&#x2019;d been stamped out on a truck assembly line. In a tuxedo, he looked official, and officially dangerous. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fucking unbelievable, I tell you. They put me on the back door because we got so many people trying to sneak in through the fucking hotel lobby. You guys coming up or what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Soon,&#x201d; Dick said. &#x201c;Get me Louie, will you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure, hold on. He&#x2019;s on the other side, giving an interview to a newspaper guy.&#x201d; <br> <i>Holy shit,</i> Cami thought. <i>Louie Lombardi giving an interview? About what? Breaking arms? Making book? Buying swag? Jesus, that&#x2019;s all we need.</i> <br>Finally, Louie&#x2019;s voice came on the phone. &#x201c;You guys don&#x2019;t want to listen to me? I&#x2019;m telling you, this joint&#x2019;s exploding. You know who I was just looking at?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Greta Garbo. That broad that wants to be left alone.&#x201d; <br>This was too much for Cami, who laughed and said, &#x201c;Greta Garbo? She doesn&#x2019;t go anywhere; it must be a look-alike.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Look-alike my ass,&#x201d; Louie said. &#x201c;This broad is Greta-fucking-Garbo, I&#x2019;m telling you. And she&#x2019;s here tonight. You guys are the only ones that ain&#x2019;t here.&#x201d; <br>Dick looked up to see his father-in-law coming into the beach cabana. Dressed immaculately in a black silk shirt, custom ivory trousers, alligator belt, and matching shoes, Johnny Biello created a barely noticeable ripple of excitement among the pool boys and sunbathers. They couldn&#x2019;t know that he was a high-ranking mafioso, <i>caporegime</i> of the Genovese crime family, at one time considered the most likely heir to Frank Costello&#x2019;s unofficial title of prime minister of the Mob. But they did know, by the way he carried himself, that he was somebody you stepped out of the way for. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Louie again, I think we better go up,&#x201d; Cami said. <br>Johnny nodded. &#x201c;Okay. Get the tickets,&#x201d; he said. <br>After Dick and Johnny landed at LaGuardia and grabbed their bags, Dick hailed a cab. When he leaned forward to give directions, Johnny put his hand on his shoulder and cut him off. <br>&#x201c;Take us to the Peppermint Lounge,&#x201d; he said. <br>Dick shot him a look of disbelief. <i>What airport cabbie was going to know the Peppermint?</i> <br>&#x201c;You kidding me?&#x201d; the driver said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t get within blocks of that place.&#x201d; <br>After deciding to take the cab into Manhattan and abandon it on the East Side, the two men made their way across 45th Street. Traffic was stopped dead between Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Long before they got to the Peppermint, they could see what looked like a street riot up ahead. Floodlights cut the night sky and the sounds of the noisy crowd bounced off the skyscrapers. <br>Cops had erected barricades and a small battalion of mounted police tried to steady their spooked horses while driving back an exuberant, barely controllable mob onto the sidewalk. At the entrance, a parade of limos dispensed women in gowns and men in tuxes. <br>The line waiting outside the candy-striped awning was a full sidewalk wide. It stretched all the way down to Broadway and beyond. The din of rock-and-roll music grew louder and became more distinct as the line approached the Peppermint&#x2019;s entrance. <br>Johnny led the way to the front door, where they were met by Lenny Montana, a six-foot-six flesh monolith known as &#x201c;the Bull&#x201d; during his time as a professional wrestler. Years later, he would be better known as the murderous Luca Brasi, Marlon Brando&#x2019;s bodyguard in <i>The Godfather</i>. Montana flashed a big grin and cracked open the door, leaving the waiting throngs buzzing with curiosity over the identities of the two men. Politicians? Movie moguls? High rollers? <br>Inside, the dim light made it hard to see. They made their way along the rope separating the long mahogany bar in the front. Three bartenders worked as fast as they could, shouting themselves hoarse and opening bottles of Chivas every few minutes. Customers were too thrilled to have made it inside to notice the acrid taste of the cheap booze Scatsy had substituted for the Chivas&#x2014;a practice from his bootlegging days in the twenties, when he and his brother Johnny worked for the Dutch Schultz mob. <br>At the end of the rope was the back of the club, where Joey Dee and the Starliters were blasting &#x201c;The Twist&#x201d; from a raised bandstand. The dance floor, just eight by twenty feet, was packed with shuddering, shimmying bodies. Mirrored walls bounced their images to infinity, jammed together, asses to elbows, moving to deafening rock-and-roll music. No two dancers moved the same way, but all were doing a version of the Twist. <br>As Dick&#x2019;s eyes adjusted, he could see that Louie was not imagining things. Sitting at the edge of the dance floor with several handsome young hangers-on was Ava Gardner, one of Hollywood&#x2019;s leading screen queens. Gardner got up and nearly shook the bolts out of her chassis. Dick decided she&#x2019;d had too much to drink. At the next table was Shirley MacLaine, one of the day&#x2019;s best young actresses. MacLaine laid claim to the dance floor, shaking and twisting like a pro. Spotting her, Joey Dee jumped down from the bandstand and wriggled alongside her. <br>If the Peppermint burns down tonight, Dick thought, only half of New York society will go with it. The other half was still waiting on line outside. <br>Johnny had connections to numerous businesses. Some he had on the arm, which meant the owners paid him to keep anyone else from doing to them what he was doing to them. Some he owned, often registering a legitimate partner&#x2019;s name on the license. Some he used as fronts, holding strategic meetings and conducting his illegal activities in the back rooms. The Peppermint Lounge he owned and used as a front. When the club became the most-asked-about New York City attraction at the Times Square information booth, the attention was neither expected nor welcomed. Drawing squads of cops, hordes of teens mixed with society types, and noted celebrities to this club or any of his business connections was never in his plans. Johnny Biello lived quietly, respectably, and always in the background. <br>The reason he had moved to Miami three years earlier, uprooting not only his family but also son-in-law Dick&#x2019;s was to distance himself from day-to-day life in gangland New York. After Frank Costello was shot, Johnny knew things in the Mob would never be the same for him and he wanted to retire. He had a great business opportunity in Florida and, while not entirely legit yet, that was the dream. <br>At age fifty-five, he had survived a lifetime of Mob wars, FBI investigations, and criminal prosecutions. He wanted out, but extricating oneself from the highest levels of organized crime in the Five Families of New York was no simple matter. Having the entire Western world&#x2019;s eye trained on the teenage rock-and-roll dance club he owned on 45th Street was not going to help. Johnny decided that it would be better to play it safe and stopped any illegal activities out of the Peppermint. But Johnny was no fool, either. Sensing an opportunity after witnessing firsthand the nightly madness that followed the club&#x2019;s meteoric rise, he decided to return to Miami Beach and open a second, all-new and completely legitimate Peppermint Lounge as quickly as possible. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by John Johnson, Jr., and Joel Selvin with Dick Cami <br></p><h2>Uncorked: My year in Provence studying P�tanque, discovering Chagall, drinking Pastis, and mangling French</h2><p><b>Will having smoke repeatedly blown in his face deter a foreigner from breaking in to French culture?</b><br><br>Paul Shore's evocative story telling, wry wit, and big heart will inspire and entertain you, as his persistence earns him acceptance inside a charming French village!<br><br>Shore humorously uses the mysterious game of P�tanque as a unique point of entry to explore areas of personal alienation faced as a newcomer in an adopted land full of heavily fortified culture.<br><br>This quirky story is not about wine, rather the "uncorking" of many of France's most cherished traditions and Shore's personal awakenings about the value of slowing down to smell-the-roses.<br><br><b>LAUGH WHILE BEING TOUCHED as you fondly reminisce about personal adventures!</b><br><b></b><br><br><b>WINNER of the WHISTLER INDEPENDENT BOOK AWARDS for Non-Fiction in 2017.</b> This adds to the acclaim received from the NEXT GENERATION INDIE BOOK AWARDS, by being named a FINALIST in their travel category for 2017.<br><b>Praise for <i>Uncorked:</i></b><br><br>"Cross-cultural endeavors never go out of style. <b>Shore will make readers smile and reminisce over their own youthful sojourns in faraway lands. </b><i>Uncorked</i> is a well written and diverting book that many readers will treasure." <br><b>--Judge's Commentary, 25th Annual Writer's Digest Self-Published Book Awards</b><br><br><b>"</b><b>Shore's use of the game of P�tanque as a point of entry to address areas of personal alienation is a great literary and narrative choice. &nbsp;</b>This memoir made me laugh; especially Paul's foil Hubert, who is a star.

Genetically distinct from their inland cousins and from wolves in any other part of the world, coastal wolves can swim like otters and fish like the bears with whom they share the rainforest. Smaller than the gray wolves that live on the other side of the Coast Mountains, these wolves are highly social and fiercely intelligent creatures.<br> <br>Living in the isolated wilderness of the Great Bear Rainforest, coastal wolves have also enjoyed a unique relationship with man. The First Nations people, who have shared their territory for thousands of years, do not see them as a nuisance species but instead have long offered the wolf a place of respect and admiration within their culture.<br> <br>Illustrated with almost one hundred of Ian McAllister's magnificent photographs, <em>The Sea Wolves</em> presents a strong case for the importance of preserving the Great Bear Rainforest for the wolves, the bears and the other unique creatures that live there.<br> <br>Want more <i>Sea Wolves</i>?

In the 1990s she was embraced by the rest of the country when the landmark exhibition of her work <i>The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis</i> travelled across Canada. By the time the tour was over, half a million people had become acquainted with her delightful work.</p> <p>Between 1938, when she married Everett Lewis, until her death in 1970, Maud Lewis lived in a tiny one-room house near Digby, Nova Scotia. Over the years, she painted the doors inside and out, the windowpanes, the walls and cupboards, the wallpaper, the little staircase to the sleeping loft, the woodstove, the breadbox, the dustpan, almost everything her hand touched. Her house was a joy to behold, and it became a magnet for tourists as well as a focal point in her village. In 1979, after Everett Lewis died, the Maud Lewis Painted House Society worked diligently to raise funds to acquire, preserve, and display the house as part of the cultural heritage of the area as well as a memorial to their beloved artist.</p> <p>In 1984, the house and its contents were purchased by the Province of Nova Scotia for the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. In <i>The Painted House of Maud Lewis</i>, Laurie Hamilton, the conservator at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, shows how all the different parts of the house &#x2014; the building itself, the painted household items, even the wallpaper &#x2014; were catalogued, conserved, and prepared for exhibition. The preliminary stages of conservation treatment began in 1996 in a most unusual location: the Sunnyside Mall in Bedford, just outside Halifax, where conservators worked in full view of the public. The conservators used established techniques and invented new ones to complete their unique project and documented every stage of the restoration photographically.</p> <p>The book also features more than sixty-five colour photos including several taken by noted photographer Bob Brooks in 1965 for the <i>Star Weekly</i>. Today, anyone can visit the tiny house that has become a folk art phenomenon. The restoration story spans two decades, but the story of the Painted House continues as each new visitor to the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia finds delight and inspiration in Maud Lewis's joyous vision.</p></p><p><p>Rescuing the tiny house of Canada's most beloved folk artist.

Estleman, Stephen White, Earlene Fowler, Ann Ripley and other top writers in the field. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.At the start of bestseller Coel's appealing 12th mystery (after 2005's <i>Eye of the Wolf</i>), the people of Wyoming's Wind River Reservation are devastated when an ancient petroglyph, the Drowning Man, vanishes from a wall of sacred Red Cliff Canyon. An Indian messenger tells Fr. John O'Malley, the pastor of St. Francis Mission, to inform the Shoshones and Arapahos they must pay a $250,000 ransom for the rock art, which was chiseled off the wall. Father John obliges, but also alerts the FBI. Meanwhile, attorney Vicky Holden decides to represent Travis Birdsong, who's serving time for killing his alleged partner in a glyph theft seven years earlier. Enraged locals, who believe Travis didn't get a fair trial, want Vicky's firm to concentrate on keeping a logging company from desecrating Red Cliff Canyon. Father John's conflicted feelings for Vicky, who's not sure she wants to stay with her partner, Adam Lone Eagle, and the arrival of a retired pedophile priest at the mission help keep the emotional temperature high. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He looks peaked.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You spoil him, Carrie. If he won&#x2019;t eat his dinner, don&#x2019;t let him go out and play. You were like that, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When I was his age, I was husky enough to cut down a tree with a hatchet. He couldn&#x2019;t cut his way out of a fog.&#x201d;<br>David would imagine himself invisible, floating unseen over their heads as they discussed him. Someone would ask if he had a girlfriend yet, and they would <em>tsk-tsk</em>whether the answer was yes or no. From his vantage point he would aim a ray gun at Uncle Clarence, whom he especially disliked, because he was fat, bald, and very rich. Uncle Clarence dipped his biscuits in his gravy, or in syrup, or more often in a mixture of sorghum and butter that he stirred together on his plate until it looked like baby shit.<br>&#x201c;Is he still planning to be a biologist? He should go to med school and join Walt in his practice.&#x201d;<br>He would point his ray gun at Uncle Clarence and cut a neat plug out of his stomach and carefully ease it out, and Uncle Clarence would ooze from the opening and flow all over them.<br>&#x201c;David.&#x201d; He started with alarm, then relaxed again. &#x201c;David, why don&#x2019;t you go out and see what the other kids are up to?&#x201d; His father&#x2019;s quiet voice, saying actually, That&#x2019;s enough of that. And they would turn their collective mind to one of the other offspring.<br>As David grew older, he learned the complex relationships that he merely accepted as a child. Uncles, aunts, cousins, second cousins, third cousins. And the honorary members--the brothers and sisters and parents of those who had married into the family. There were the Sumners and Wistons and O&#x2019;Gradys and Heinemans and the Meyers and Capeks and Rizzos, all part of the same river that flowed through the fertile valley.<br>He remembered the holidays especially. The old Sumner house was rambling with many bedrooms upstairs and an attic that was wall-to-wall mattresses, pallets for the children, with an enormous fan in the west window. Someone was forever checking to make certain that they hadn&#x2019;t all suffocated in the attic. The older children were supposed to keep an eye on the younger ones, but what they did in fact was to frighten them night after night with ghost stories. Eventually the noise level would rise until adult intervention was demanded. Uncle Ron would clump up the stairs heavily and there would be a scurrying, with suppressed giggles and muffled screams, until everyone found a bed again, so that by the time he turned on the hall light that illuminated the attic dimly, all the children would seem to be sleeping. He would pause briefly in the doorway, then close the door, turn off the light, and tramp back down the stairs, apparently deaf to the renewed merriment behind him.<br>Whenever Aunt Claudia came up, it was like an apparition. One minute pillows would be flying, someone would be crying, someone else trying to read by flashlight, several of the boys playing cards by another flashlight, some of the girls huddled together whispering what had to be delicious secrets, judging by the way they blushed and looked desperate if an adult came upon them suddenly, and then the door would snap open, the light would fall on the disorder, and she would be standing there. Aunt Claudia was very tall and thin, her nose was too big, and she was tanned to a permanent old-leather color. She would stand there, immobile and terrible, and the children would creep back into bed without a sound. She would not move until everyone was back where he or she belonged, then she would close the door soundlessly. The silence would drag on and on. The ones nearest to the door would hold their breath, trying to hear breathing on the other side. Eventually someone would become brave enough to open the door a crack, and if she were truly gone, the party would resume.<br>The smells of holidays were fixed in David&#x2019;s memory. All the usual smells: fruit cakes and turkeys, the vinegar that went in the egg dyes, the greenery and the thick, creamy smoke of bayberry candles. But what he remembered most vividly was the smell of gunpowder that they all carried at the Fourth of July gathering. The smell that permeated their hair and clothes lasted on their hands for days and days. Their hands would be stained purple-black by berry picking, and the color and smell were one of the indelible images of his childhood. Mixed in with it was the smell of the sulfur that was dusted on them liberally to confound the chiggers.<br>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Celia, his childhood would have been perfect. Celia was his cousin, his mother&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s daughter. She was one year younger than David, and by far the prettiest of all his cousins. When they were very young they promised to marry one day, and when they grew older and it was made abundantly clear that no cousins might ever marry in that family, they became implacable enemies. He didn&#x2019;t know how they had been told. He was certain that no one ever put it in words, but they knew. When they could not avoid each other after that, they fought. She pushed him out of the hayloft and broke his arm when he was fifteen, and when he was sixteen they wrestled from the back door of the Winston farmhouse to the fence, fifty or sixty yards away. They tore the clothes off each other, and he was bleeding from her fingernails down his back, she from scraping her shoulder on a rock. Then somehow in their rolling and squirming frenzy, his cheek came down on her uncovered chest, and he stopped fighting. He suddenly became a melting, sobbing, incoherent idiot and she hit him on the head with a rock and ended the fight.<br>Up to that point the battle had been in almost total silence, broken only by gasps for breath and whispered language that would have shocked their parents. But when she hit him and he went limp, not unconscious, but dazed, uncaring, inert, she screamed, abandoning herself to terror and anguish. The family tumbled from the house as if they had been shaken out, and their first impression must have been that he had raped her. His father hustled him to the barn, presumably for a thrashing. But in the barn his father, belt in hand, looked at him with an expression that was furious, and strangely sympathetic. He didn&#x2019;t touch David, and only after he had turned and left did David realize that tears were still running down his face.<br>In the family there were farmers, a few lawyers, two doctors, insurance brokers and bankers and millers, hardware merchandisers, other shopkeepers. David&#x2019;s father owned a large department store that catered to the upper-middle-class clientele of the valley. The valley was rich, the farms in it large and lush. David always supposed that the family, except for a few ne&#x2019;er-do-wells, was rather wealthy. Of all his relatives his favorite was his father&#x2019;s brother Walt. Dr. Walt, they all called him, never uncle. He played with the children and taught them grown-up things, like where to hit if you really meant it, where not to hit in a friendly scrap. He seemed to know when to stop treating them as children long before anyone else in the family did. Dr. Walt was the reason David had decided very early to become a scientist.<br>David was seventeen when he went to Harvard. His birthday was in September and he didn&#x2019;t go home for it. When he did return at Thanksgiving, and the clan had gathered, Grandfather Sumner poured the ritual before-dinner martinis and handed one to him. And Uncle Warner said to him, &#x201c;What do you think we should do about Bobbie?&#x201d;<br>He had arrived at that mysterious crossing that is never delineated clearly enough to see in advance. He sipped his martini, not liking it particularly, and knew that childhood had ended, and he felt a profound sadness and loneliness.<br>The Christmas that David was twenty-three seemed out of focus. The scenario was the same, the attic full of children, the food smells, the powdering of snow, none of that had changed, but he was seeing it from a new position and it was not the wonderland it had been. When his parents went home he stayed on at the Wiston farm for a day or two, waiting for Celia&#x2019;s arrival. She had missed the Christmas Day celebration, getting ready for her coming trip to Brazil, but she would be there, her mother had assured Grandmother Wiston, and David was waiting for her, not happily, not with any expectation of reward, but with a fury that grew and caused him to stalk the old house like a boy being punished for another&#x2019;s sin.<br>When she came home and he saw her standing with her mother and grandmother, his anger melted. It was like seeing Celia in a time distortion, as she was and would be, or had been. Her pale hair would not change much, but her bones would become more prominent and the almost emptiness of her face would have written on it a message of concern, of love, of giving, of being decisively herself, of a strength unsuspected in her frail body. Grandmother Wiston was a beautiful old lady, he thought in wonder, amazed that he never had seen her beauty before. Celia&#x2019;s mother was more beautiful than the girl. And he saw the resemblance to his own mother in the trio. Wordlessly, defeated, he turned and went to the rear of the house and put on one of his grandfather&#x2019;s heavy jackets because he didn&#x2019;t want to see her at all now and his own outdoor clothing was in the front hall closet too near where she was standing.<br>He walked a long time in the frosty afternoon, seeing very little, and shaking himself from time to time when he realized that the cold was entering his shoes or making his ears numb. He should turn back, he thought often, but he walked on. And he found that he was climbing the slope to the antique forest that his grandfather had taken him to once, a long time ago. He climbed an...</p></p><h2>Freedom&#39;s Pen: A Story Based on the Life of the Young Freed Slave and Poet Phillis Wheatley (Daughters of the Faith Series)</h2><p><p>1761&#x2014;Phillis Wheatley was a little girl of seven or eight years old when she was captured in Gambia and brought to America as a slave. But she didn&#x2019;t let her circumstances keep her down. </p><p>She learned to read and write in English and Latin, and showed a natural gift for poetry. By the time she was twelve, her elegy at the death of the great pastor George Whitefield brought her worldwide acclaim. Phillis became known to heads of state, including George Washington himself, speaking out for American independence and the end of slavery. </p><p>She became the first African American to publish a book, and her writings would eventually win her freedom. More importantly, her poetry still proclaims Christ almost 250 years later.</p><p><i>Freedom&#x2019;s Pen </i>is part of the <i>Daughters of the Faith</i> series, which has sold more than 120,000 copies and is popular for at least two reasons. Firstly, it explores the lives of girls who made a difference <i>while they were still young</i>, not when they grew up, inspiring today&#x2019;s young girl readers.

Although both groups engaged in civil rights struggles as victims of similar forms of racism and discrimination, they were rarely unified. In <i>Fighting Their Own Battles</i>, Brian Behnken explores the cultural dissimilarities, geographical distance, class tensions, and organizational differences that all worked to separate Mexican Americans and blacks. <br><br>Behnken further demonstrates that prejudices on both sides undermined the potential for a united civil rights campaign. Coalition building and cooperative civil rights efforts foundered on the rocks of perceived difference, competition, distrust, and, oftentimes, outright racism. Behnken's in-depth study reveals the major issues of contention for the two groups, their different strategies to win rights, and significant thematic developments within the two civil rights struggles. By comparing the histories of these movements in one of the few states in the nation to witness two civil rights movements, Behnken bridges the fields of Mexican American and African American history, revealing the myriad causes that ultimately led these groups to "fight their own battles."<br><br></p><p>"This compelling and extensively researched book is the first major historical analysis to trace the roots of the generally separate, and often disparate, efforts of African Americans and Mexican Americans for equal rights under the law. Behnken's insightful scholarship makes this a pioneering study in U.S. and Texas history. It should spark debate and, I hope, shed more light on this complex and significant subject."--Amilcar Shabazz, University of Massachusetts, Amherst <br>Behnken explores the cultural dissimilarities, geographical distance, class tensions, and organizational differences that all worked to separate blacks&#39; and Mexican Americans&#39; civil rights struggles in Texas.</p><h2>Elemental Magic: All-New Tales of the Elemental Masters</h2><p>Among Mercedes Lackey&#x2019;s many novels, few are as critically acclaimed and beloved as those about the Elemental Masters.

Accordingly, he turned to the deepest, most spiritual of the Gospels&#x2015;that of the initiate St. John. <br><br> In this lecture course, readers will find that the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Divine Word, or Logos, reveals the mission of the Earth: Love. We learn of the mysteries behind Lazarus' resurrection, the "I AM" sayings, and the seven degrees of initiation. We come to understand that the Gospel of St. John is a continuing spiritual presence&#x2015;to be recalled, meditated, and permeated with one's own life. In doing so, we realized that our purpose&#x2015;and that of all humankind&#x2015;is to become the Virgin Sophia, a receptical for the Holy Spirit. <br><br> All of Steiner's work, as Marie Steiner writes in her introduction, was "to pave the way to Christ." Indeed, at the conclusion of these lectures, Rudolf Steiner said: <blockquote>It will come to be understood that Christianity is only beginning its influence and will fulfill its real mission only when it is understood in its true, spiritual form.... The more these lectures are understood in this sense, the better they will be understood as they were intended.</blockquote> This volume is essential if one is to truly understand Rudolf Steiner's understanding of esoteric Christianity and its place in the world today and in the future. <br><br> <b>Contents:</b> <ol> <li> The Doctrine of the Logos</li> <li> Esoteric Christianity</li> <li> The Mission of the Earth</li> <li> The Raising of Lazarus</li> <li> The Seven Degrees of Initiation</li> <li> The "I AM"</li> <li> The Mystery of Golgotha</li> <li> Human Evolution in Its Relation to the Christ Principle</li> <li> The Prophetical Documents of the Origin of Christianity</li> <li> The Effect of the Christ Principle</li> <li> Christian Initiation</li> <li> The Nature of the Virgin Sophia and of the Holy Spirit</li> </ol> This volume is a translation of <i><b>Das Johannes-Evangelium</b></i> (GA 103).</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Cold Earth: A Novel</h2><p>A team of six archaeologists from the United States, England, and Scotland assembles at the beginning of the Arctic summer to unearth traces of the lost Viking settlements in Greenland.

"Conversation," he said.</p><p>The AD held up a megaphone and shouted, "Conversation!"</p><p>At once, a hundred and fifty extras, packed into a set that was a replica of Sardi's, the famous theater-district restaurant in New York, began to talk.</p><p>"Acton," Rick said quietly.</p><p>"Speed," the camera operator replied.</p><p>Waiters began to move among the tables.</p><p>"Cue the entrance," Rick said.</p><p>"Entrance," the AD said into a microphone hanging around his neck. He signaled the dolly man, and the camera began to roll smoothly down the restaurant's main aisle toward the entrance of the restaurant.</p><p>The front door opened, and his leading lady, Glenna Gleason, wearing a gorgeous evening gown and followed by another actress and two actors, all in evening dress, walked in and were greeted by a Vincent Sardi look-alike. As they walked past the small bar and entered the dining room, the camera backtracked, and, on cue, all the diners stood and applauded.</p><p>Glenna managed to look shocked, then delighted as she followed "Sardi" to their table along the wall. The camera stopped and moved in closer as a microphone boom was lowered over the false wall to pick up their dialogue.</p><p>"My God," Glenna said, "I didn't know it would be like this."</p><p>The actor on her left turned to her. "Katherine," he said, "it's going to be like this from now on."</p><p>On Rick's signal, the camera began to dolly slowly away from the table and, keeping Glenna's party in the center of the frame, rose to a height of twelve feet and stopped.</p><p>"Keep the conversation going," Rick said from his chair on the boom next to the camera. He sat and watched the stopwatch in his hand for ninety seconds, which was what they needed to roll under the closing titles. "Cut!" he yelled, finally. "Print it! That's a wrap!" It was the fourth take, and it was perfect. They had shot the three scenes at Sardi's all on the same day, and now it was done: Rick had made his first feature film as a director. He sagged with relief as the camera operator pounded him on the back.</p><p>Then, to his astonishment, every actor on the set rose from his seat and gave the director a standing ovation. Rick stood up, holding on to the camera for support, then turned and faced the bulk of the crowd, "Cut!" he yelled again. "Start the party!"</p><p>A part of the rear wall of the set was rolled away, revealing a huge buffet table and a bar serving real booze instead of the tea in the prop glasses on the table. The crowd of extras surged toward the food and drink, and Rick signaled the boom operator to lower the camera to the floor. He hopped off and slid into a banquette beside his wife, giving her a big kiss. "Glenna, my darling, that was great. It's going to be wonderful, the whole thing."</p><p>Two of the actors got up from the table and made way for Eddie Harris, the chairman of Centurion Studios, and Sidney Brooks, the famous New York playwright, who had written the script for <i>Times Square Dance.</i></p><p>"Rick," Eddie said, "congratulations."</p><p>Champagne appeared and was poured.</p><p>"I thought the last scene went beautifully," Brooks said to everybody.</p><p>"Sid, we're going to do your script proud," Rick said. "Just give me a couple of days, and I'll show you a rough cut."</p><p>"I can't wait," Brooks replied.</p><p>"I have to go pee," Glenna said, and Rick let her out of the banquette. The actor playing her husband got up, too, leaving Rick, Eddie Harris and Sidney Brooks at the table.</p><p>"Fellas," Brooks said, "I have to tell you something."</p><p>Rick looked at the man across the table. For the first time since he had met the playwright, the man looked less than happy.</p><p>"What's up, Sid?" Eddie asked.</p><p>"I wanted to tell you before it hits the papers tomorrow," Brooks said.</p><p>"Tell us what?" Rick asked.</p><p>"I've been subpoenaed by the House of Un-American Activities Committee, along with eighteen other people, mostly writers but a few actors and one director."</p><p>"Oh, shit," Eddie said. "Well, don't worry about it; get a good lawyer."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Sid," Rick said, "But Eddie is right about the lawyer."</p><p>"There's a meeting tomorrow," Brooks replied. "I want to tell you fellows..."</p><p>"You don't need to tell us anything," Eddie said.</p><p>"You mean, you'd rather not know, don't you Eddie?"</p><p>"The first thing your lawyer is going to tell you is to shut up," Eddie said. "I'm just giving you a head start; don't say anything to anybody, unless your lawyer approves it first."</p><p>"I'm not looking to drag anybody into this," Brooks said. "I just want to be honest with you. This picture has been the best experience I've had since I came out here four years ago; it's the first picture that's given me the same sort of satisfaction that writing a play used to."</p><p>"Look, Sid," Rick said, "these people are going to hold their hearings, grill some movie stars, and then it'll be over. Six months from now you'll have put it behind you."</p><p>Brooks set his briefcase on the table, opened it and pulled out a thick manila envelope. "I've been working on this for two years," he said. "I've never told anybody about it, but it's the best thing I've ever written for either the stage or film, and after the wonderful experience I've had with the production of <i>Times Square Dance</i>, I want you fellows to produce it, and, Rick, I'd be delighted if you'd direct again."</p><p>"Thank you, Sid," Rick said, and he meant it. "I'll read it tonight."</p><p>"Tell your agent to call Rick in the morning," Eddie said, "We'll have a deal before lunchtime."</p><p>"But you haven't even read it, Eddie," Brooks said, laughing.</p><p>"I don't need to. I'll buy it sight unseen."</p><p>Rick knew that wasn't quite true, but he knew that Eddie expected to like the script; he would want Rick's opinion first, though.</p><p>"It's a western," Brooks said.</p><p>"<i>What</i>?" Rick exclaimed. "The theater's urban genius has written a western?"</p><p>"The grittiest, down-and-dirtiest western you ever saw," Brooks said. "I love westerns, and I've always wanted to write one; to tell you the truth, it's the principal reason I came out here, just to get the opportunity. I've had the idea for a long time, but it wouldn't work on the stage, and I didn't want it produced without the level of participation you fellows have given me."</p><p>"Thank you, Sid," Rick said.</p><p>Glenna returned from the ladies' room and sat down. "I called home," she said. "The girls are fine, and I told Rosie to give them dinner and put them to bed. I take it we'll be here for a while."</p><p>"I think we will," Rick said. "I think I'd better circulate and thank everybody." He handed Brooks' script to her. "Guard this with your life," he said. "It's the next Sidney Brooks film."</p><p>"Oh, is there a part for me?" she asked excitedly.</p><p>"I haven't read it yet, sweetheart; I'll let you know tomorrow." Rick got up and began making his way around the Sardi's set, shaking hands, hugging and kissing and enduring many claps on the back.</p><p>A moment later, Eddie Harris caught up with him.

In a satanic bargain, Melmoth exchanges his soul for immortality. The story of his tortured wanderings through the centuries is pieced together through those who have been implored by Melmoth to take over his pact with the devil. Influenced by the Gothic romances of the late 18th century, Maturin's diabolic tale raised the genre to a new and macabre pitch.

Why didn't I know that?' <p>'You mean we used to be called Disciples of Christ? I thought that was just another denomination.' </p><p>'Churches of Christ today believe and practice the same things we have from the beginning, don't we?' </p><p>Statements like these by members of Churches of Christ reflect a serious lack of knowledge of our past and an increasing desire by many to know more of their heritage. This desire has led us to believe there is a need for a brief account of the history of Churches of Christ. This book hopes to serve newcomers and even long-time members of the church by giving them insights into our heritage. It also is an introduction to this significant group of churches for those unfamiliar with its place in American Christianity.</p></p><p>Dr. Gary Holloway is Ijams Professor of Bible and the Associate Director of the Center for Spiritual Renewal at Lipscomb University, and preaches at the Natchez Trace Church in Nashville, Tennessee.

Pullman is at work on a companion His Dark Materials novel, <i>The Book of Dust</i>. He lives in Oxford, England.&#x201c;Pullman&#x2019;s <i>Fairy Tales</i> offers something unique: the chance to watch a master storyteller think through these most foundational of tales. . . . It is fascinating.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Zippy! . . . These tales are about plot and economy and speed [and] make great bedtime read-alouds for children who can handle a little gore. . . . The original tales weren&#x2019;t for children, of course; they were for everyone. So is this book. . . . Pullman is both erudite and funny. . . . He has fun with dialogue, and is particularly snappy with dwarfs. . . . You know what? He crushes it, as the youth of today are wont to say. . . . His translations are perfection.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It is such a pleasure to read these tales again, to experience their strangeness and richness, their violence and beauty, their sheer nonsense. . . .

This is the kind of writing that stands up to years of bedtime repetition. . . . The author&#x2019;s best appearances are in the notes, which are often as entertaining as the stories themselves. . . . Swiftness and clarity, he says, were his guiding principles; to which he has added wit and invention. . . . Beautiful or grotesque, the mad poetry of these tales is often delightfully funny too.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The Economist</i></b><br>&#x201c;<b>A fresh, sparkling collection</b> of the finest stories from the Brothers Grimm, hand-picked by an author perfectly suited to the task.

You do.<b> This is a grand and a great book.</b> With confidence and modesty alike, Pullman adds just enough Pullman to remind us that the oldest stories are always best told by someone who knows how to do the job of storytelling. No grandstanding here, no posturing or poesy-making.

As storyteller and sage, he preserves the flavors and aromas of fine, old wines from times past and delivers them to us in <b>sparkling</b> new bottles.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Maria Tatar</b>, Harvard University; author of <i>The Classic Fairy Tales</i><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve admired Philip Pullman since his early fantasy <i>Galatea</i> on through the splendid trilogy His Dark Materials.

Carrie is the head of Wells Fargo's regional banking group, a position she has held for the last four years and in which she has been inordinately successful. As with many effective leaders, though, she is by nature self-critical. Despite the fact that she had just delivered a rousing speech to her regional managers, I was not overly surprised to find her standing off by herself looking a little dissatisfied.<br><br>"What's up?" I said. "The speech went really well." One always tends to offer reassurance to speakers after a speech, but in this case it was accurate. She had been speaking on the subject of customer service and how, with most banking products being a commodity in the marketplace, Wells Fargo would live or die based on the quality of its service. This message isn't new, either for Wells Fargo or the wider business world, and in the wrong hands it can pretty quickly descend into clich�. But Carrie had managed to keep the message coherent, the stories personal, and the examples vivid and powerful. It was a good speech.<br><br>"I don't know," she replied. "Sometimes I'm not sure how effective these speeches really are. The regional managers will now try to pass the message on to their district managers, and inevitably it will get tweaked in some way, changed somehow. Then it'll get changed again when the district managers pass it on to their store managers, and again when the store supervisors hear it, until, by the time it reaches the people who can really use it -- our customer service reps and personal bankers -- it will be significantly altered.<br><br>"Don't get me wrong, it's good that each level of my organization adds its own spin, but still, I sometimes think that the only way to keep this organization on the same page about customer service is to boil it down to its essence. My message should be so simple and so clear that, across all forty-three thousand employees, everyone comes to know what's at the core."<br><br>At the time, I think I mumbled something about being sure that her message would get through to where it mattered most, but on a subliminal level her wish -- to see a subject so clearly that she could describe its essence simply, but without oversimplification -- must have registered. For weeks thereafter, no matter where I went on my travels, no matter whom I was talking to, I seemed to hear the same wish: "Get me to the heart of the matter."<br><br>Sure, the subject in question varied. Some people wanted to know the organizing principle of great management. Others were more interested in the essence of great leadership. Others asked about the driving force behind a successful career. But everywhere the wish was the same: Get me to the core.<br><br>Now, I suppose I could have chalked these wishes up to intellectual laziness. Why struggle with complex reality when you can skate by on the PowerPoint version of life instead? But this is a rather uncharitable and, in the end, unhelpful interpretation. We are all attracted to clarified versions of reality not because we are intellectually lazy, but because these versions often wind up being so useful. Take winter, spring, summer, and fall as an example. The four seasons are the PowerPoint version of the weather. Certainly they leave out a great deal of complexity, exception, and local variation, but nonetheless they've helped generations of farmers time their sowing and harvesting.<br><br>If there were any charges of intellectual laziness to be leveled, they probably should have been leveled at me. For seventeen years I had the good fortune to work with one of the most respected research organizations in the world, the Gallup Organization. During this time, I was given the opportunity to interview some of the world's best leaders, managers, teachers, salespeople, stockbrokers, lawyers, and all manner of public servants. The fact that I hadn't isolated a few core insights at the heart of great leadership, or managing, or sustained individual success didn't mean that these insights didn't exist. It simply meant I hadn't yet been focused enough to get it done.<br><br>Carrie's wish, and the many similar wishes I heard in the months following, pushed me to get focused. Since people wanted to reach down into the heart of the matter, I was, I realized, in a perfect position to help them get there. My research experiences at Gallup mostly consisted of surveying large numbers of people in the hopes of finding broad patterns in the data. Now, in my effort to get to the core, I would use this foundation as the jumping-off point for deeper, more immersive, more individualized research. I wouldn't survey a large number of good performers. Instead I would identify one or two elite players, one or two people who, in their chosen roles and fields, had measurably, consistently, and dramatically outperformed their peers. In the end these individuals covered a wide range, from the executive who transformed a failing drug into the best-selling prescription drug in the world, the president of one of the world's largest retailers, the customer service representative who sold more than fifteen hundred Gillette deodorants in one month, the miner who hadn't suffered a single workplace injury in over fifty years, all the way to the screenwriter who penned such blockbusters as <i>Jurassic Park</i> and <i>Spider-Man.</i><br><br>And having identified them, I planned to investigate the practical, seemingly banal details of their actions and their choices. Why did the executive turn down repeated promotions before taking on the challenge of turning around that failing drug? Why did the retail president invoke the memories of his working-class upbringing when defining his company's strategy? The deodorant-selling customer service representative works the night shift. Is this relevant to her performance? One of her hobbies is weightlifting. Odd? Yes, but can it in any way explain why she is so successful so consistently? What was each of these special people actually doing that made them so very good at their role?<br><br>I have chosen to focus this deep dive on the three roles that are the most critical if you are to achieve something significant in your life and then sustain and expand this achievement, namely the roles of manager, leader, and individual performer. In part 1 of the book we focus on the two roles that underpin sustained <i>organizational</i> success.<br><br><b><i>What is the One Thing you need to know about great managing?</i></b><br><br>To get the best performance from your people, you have to be able to execute a number of different roles very well. You have to be able to select people effectively. You have to set expectations by defining clearly the outcomes you want. You have to motivate people by focusing on their strengths and managing around their weaknesses. And, as they challenge you to help them grow, you have to learn how to steer them toward roles that truly fit them, rather than simply promoting them up the corporate ladder.<br><br>Each of these roles involves significant subtlety and complexity. But, without denying this complexity, is there one deep insight that underpins all of these roles and that all great managers keep in the top of their minds? The chapter on great managing supplies the answer.<br><br><i><b>What is the One Thing you need to know about great leading?</b></i><br><br>When you study truly effective leaders, the first thing that strikes you is just how different they are. I could use any number of examples from today's business world, but instead, think back to the first four presidents of the United States. Although each of them experienced great success in rallying people toward a better future, their styles could not have been more dissimilar. George Washington's leadership style was to project an image of soundness and constancy, but he is not remembered as an inspiring visionary. In direct contrast, the second U.S. president, John Adams, was an inspiring visionary. He was so gifted a public speaker that he could hold a vociferous Congress in rapt silence for hours. However, as his struggles following the end of the Revolutionary War revealed, he was at his best only when railing against a perceived foe -- which, most of the time, happened to be Great Britain.<br><br>His successor, Thomas Jefferson, did not require a foe to bring out the best in him. Sitting alone at his writing desk he could conjure compelling word pictures from the blank sheets in front of him -- and yet, in contrast to Adams, he so feared public speaking that he changed the protocol so that all of his State of the Union addresses were written out and then handed to an assistant who ran down the street and delivered them to Congress.<br><br>James Madison was different again. He was a small man with a light voice who was unable to rely on inspiring word pictures to lead. Undeterred, he opted for a more pragmatic, political approach, working the floor of Congress and, one by one, building the alliances necessary to advance his agenda.<br><br>Despite these obvious differences and imperfections, each of these individuals is rightly upheld as a model of excellence in leadership. Thus, my question for the chapter on great leading is "When you study models of excellence in leadership -- whether 250-year-old models or those of the present -- can you look past the superficial idiosyncrasies and identify one primary insight that explains why they excel?"<br><br>In part 2 we shift our focus to sustained <i>individual</i> success.<br><br><i><b>What is the One Thing you need to know about sustained individual success?</b></i><br><br>During the course of your life you will inevitably be exposed to all manner of options, opportunities, and pressures. The key to sustaining success is to be able to filter all these possibilities and fasten on to those few that will allow you to express the best of yourself. But what filter should you use? Should you actively seek out experiences that will enable you to acquire a broad range of expertise, so that you have something to fall back on when one expertise become obsolete? Should you stick with a role that doesn't suit you, thereby proving to your superiors that you are a good soldier, willing to play any role for the benefit of the team? Should you imagine that your career has distinct stages and that the filter used in the early stages should be replaced with new ones as your career progresses? Or does it all depend on what kind of career you have chosen, or even what kind of personality you have?<br><br>In chapters 5, 6, and 7, we come to grips with these questions and reveal the one insight you must never forget as you strive for sustained individual success.<br><br><b>A lifetime of "why"s</b><br><br><i>"What drove this book?"</i><br><br>Before we get started, a word about myself. We're going to be in each other's company for the next few hours (days? plane rides?), so you should probably know whom you're dealing with. Although in one sense I owe the impetus for this book to my conversation with Carrie Tolstedt, in another sense, it was almost inevitable that at some point in my life I would sit down to write this book.<br><br>I always found the movie <i>City Slickers</i> a little disappointing. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy it -- the story of three stuck-in-a-rut New Yorkers heading out to a dude ranch in the American West to learn about life and friendship and loyalty is charming, and Billy Crystal, the lead, is as hysterical as ever. No, what always bothered me about the movie was that it teases the viewer and then fails to deliver on its tease. About thirty minutes into the movie, Billy's character is trying to engage the ranch's trail boss, played by Jack Palance as a stone-faced loner, in a debate about the meaning of life. Disdainful of Billy's frenetic city-boy prattle, Palance's character, Curly, turns in the saddle to face him and holds up one finger.<br><br>"I'll tell you the secret to life. This one thing. Just this one thing. You stick to that and everything else don't mean s -- -- ."<br><br>"What's the one thing?" Billy's character asks.<br><br>"That's what you've got to figure out," Curly replies.<br><br>Since this answer didn't satisfy me, I sat through the entire movie in the hope of learning what the one thing really was. It wasn't a good sign when Curly died about an hour in, but still I stuck with it, confident that a sentimental Hollywood film would never set me up so blatantly and then fail to follow through on the punch line. But it did. At the end of the movie, when Billy and his two chums are standing on the mountain top, pondering their recent daring, their life lessons learned, and Curly, the philosopher-trail boss, Billy announces that he now sees clearly the path ahead of him.<br><br>"Why?" asks one chum.<br><br>"Because I know what he meant."<br><br>"Who?"<br><br>"Curly." Billy holds up one finger. "I know what he meant by this."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>Billy then proceeds to say exactly what Curly had said an hour earlier: "That's what you've got to figure out."<br><br>"I'm gonna deck you," says his friend.<br><br>Well, my thought exactly.<br><br>"That's what you've got to figure out." What kind of an answer is that? I was holding out for something deep and meaningful and, above all, short, some pithy little phrase that I could quote around the water cooler the next day, something like Bogart's line in <i>Casablanca,</i> "The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world," or Laurence Fishburne's in <i>The Matrix,</i> "Welcome to the desert of real" (said very slowly). I would even have settled for something akin to Ali MacGraw's "Love means never having to say you're sorry." But no, all <i>City Slickers</i> could give me was "That's what you've got to figure out."<br><br>I suppose I have only myself to blame for expecting a summer blockbuster to deliver some deep truth, but, to be honest, I have always been attracted to the notion that beneath complex phenomena such as loyalty, or productivity, or career success, or even happy marriage, you can discover a core concept. And that armed with this core concept, you can focus your attention, see the causes more clearly, and so waste less time, be precise, make accurate predictions, and act with precision to make these predictions come true. The very idea that these core concepts exist, and can be discovered, is thrilling to me.<br><br>Many of my most vivid memories stem from the discovery of a core concept that, all by itself, served to clarify something that, a moment before, had seemed unfathomably, ineffably complex.<br><br>I remember sitting in chapel one morning -- all good English public-school boys started their day in chapel -- and hearing 1 Corinthians 13:13 for the first time: "And now faith, hope, and love, abide these three; and the greatest of these is love."<br><br>I didn't fully understand its import then, and perhaps I still don't, but I can recall being terribly excited that Saint Paul had done the analysis and concluded that, while all three were great, love was the greatest.<br><br>Since then my pantheon of certifiably cool concepts has grown. Some were deemed cool simply because they applied to me personally. From the time I was about three until just after my twelfth birthday I was cursed with a terrible stammer. Along with being hugely embarrassing, it was also, on the days when I was feeling rational enough to ponder it, intellectually perplexing. Why did I stammer? Why couldn't I say my name without drawing it out into a mess of staccato consonants and bizarrely elongated...</p><h2>Red Sky in Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss, and Survival at Sea</h2><p>Picture yourself in a tropical climate, sailing out to sea with your fianc�.

Focusing on Christology, soteriology, theology, anthropology, ecclesiology, ethics, and eschatology, Matera explores both the unity and the diversity of the thirteen Pauline letters.<br><br>Written in a clear and coherent style, <i>God's Saving Grace</i> presents students, professors, and pastors with a comprehensive yet concise and accessible overview of the theology found in the entire corpus of Paul's letters.</p><p>Frank J.

His previous books include New Testament Ethics: The Legacies of Jesus and Paul and commentaries on Galatians, 2 Corinthians, and Romans.<b>John P. Meier</b><br> -- University of Notre Dame<br> "Throughout my years of teaching, I have learned to look to Frank Matera as a sure guide to the thought of Paul. His commentaries on Paul's various epistles are sterling examples of profound thought expressed with clarity and simplicity. This new distillation of Matera's thought on Paul is to be welcomed by all teachers of the New Testament."<br><br><b>Marion L. Soards</b><br> -- Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary<br> "Clarity of thought and expression distinguishes this fresh (and refreshing) contribution to the study of Pauline theology. Matera sets for himself the bold task of explaining how the thirteen different Pauline letters are related to and cohere with one another theologically. . . . This volume is a <i>must</i> for all who are interested in Pauline theology."<br><br><b>Michael J. Gorman</b><br> -- St. Mary's Seminary<br> "For some time now we have needed a contemporary Pauline theology that considers all thirteen letters without overlooking the differences among them. Frank Matera has given us just such a book. It embodies the solid, careful, yet creative scholarship for which he is known. Most importantly, Matera rightly stresses the grace of God in Christ that grabbed hold of Paul and shaped both his life and his theology. This book will enrich our understanding of that amazing grace."<br><br><b>Paul J. Achtemeier</b><br> -- Union Presbyterian Seminary<br> "Written with his usual clarity of organization and thought, Matera here presents a treatment of Pauline theology based on the Pauline material in the New Testament, not a theology of the historic Paul as best as we can recover it. . . . The volume represents a solid discussion of the Pauline theology upon which the church has drawn since its inception. The book is worth a careful reading."<br><br><b>A. Andrew Das</b><br> -- Elmhurst College<br> "Frank Matera's <i>God's Saving Grace</i> is the much-anticipated culmination of a lifetime of work. . . .

Matera&#x2019;s Pauline theology is the work of an accomplished scholar. A distillation of many years of studying, teaching, and writing about Paul, the book is a model of erudition made accessible to nonspecialists. . . .&nbsp; I can give no higher recommendation than to say that I have recently used this book with great profit in my course on Paul and his writings.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Trinity Journal</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Frank Matera draws upon his considerable expertise in Pauline studies to create a clear and insightful synthesis of the theology of Paul&#x2019;s letters. . . .

Recommended as a Bible study resource for academic and parish libraries.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Interpretation</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;For some time, both the academy and the church have needed a Pauline theology that engages all thirteen letters without overlooking the differences among them. This is such a book: not a theology of Paul confined to the seven undisputed letters, but a theological treatment of the entire Pauline corpus, the canonical Paul.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;In this welcome contribution to Pauline studies, Frank Matera gives readers a compendium of Paul&#x2019;s theology that is relatively concise and yet covers the breadth of the great apostle&#x2019;s contribution. . . . If you want a reasonably sized engagement with the thinking reflected in Paul&#x2019;s letters, you could hardly go astray with this book. It is clearly the product of a mature scholar who has thought long and reflected deeply on the words of Paul and their implications for understanding the Christian faith. It is well organized and clearly written. He lets Paul&#x2019;s letters speak for themselves in a thoroughly engaging way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Journal of Theological Studies</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;I hope this affordable volume from Eerdmans will find its way into the hands of many readers of Paul and New Testament theology. In a masterly way Matera has again demonstrated his ability of conveying theology from the pages of the New Testament into a handy format for student on all levels.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Theology </i></b><br> &#x201c;A wonderful treatment, which I would recommend as an introduction to the theology of Paul&#x2019;s letters for students, pastors and theological minded laypeople. . . . An accessible book written in a straightforward manner that avoids bulky discussions on esoteric topics within Pauline interpretation and is to be commended as a valuable resource.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Choice</i></b> (American Library Association)&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A biblical theology of the Pauline epistles. . . . The book is well-written, well-argued, and well-indexed. Recommended.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Spirit &amp; Life</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Organized and clearly written, this is a contemporary Pauline theology that looks with skill and scholarship at all thirteen letters attributed to Paul. It is a help toward understanding how Paul lived his life in terms of Christ.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Bible Today</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;This is an excellent synthesis of Pauline theology. . . . A valuable resource for a broad, yet biblically and theologically literate audience.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Louvain Studies</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;It was a wonderful experience to slowly digest the various insights which Matera&#x2019;s rich and evocative book put before me. There are many thoughtful and reflective readings of Paul&#x2019;s letters to be found here.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Biblical Theology Bulletin</i></b><br> "The task Matera sets for himself in this book is prodigious &#x2014; and he accomplishes it masterfully. . . . This is an excellent summary and starting point for understanding the theology of these letters.

Marc Bloch wrote Strange Defeat during the three months following the fall of France, after he returned home from military service. In the midst of his anguish, he nevertheless "brought to his study of the crisis all the critical faculty and all the penetrating analysis of a first-rate historian" (Christian Science Monitor). Bloch takes a close look at the military failures he witnessed, examining why France was unable to respond to attack quickly and effectively. He gives a personal account of the battle of France, followed by a biting analysis of the generation between the wars. His harsh conclusion is that the immediate cause of the disaster was the utter incompetence of the High Command, but his analysis ranges broadly, appraising all the factors, social as well as military, which since 1870 had undermined French national solidarity. "Much has been, and will be, written in explanation of the defeat of France in 1940, but it seems unlikely that the truth of the matter will ever be more accurately and more vividly presented than in this statement of evidence." - P. J. Philip, New York Times Book Review "The most wisdom-packed commentary on the problem set [before] all intelligent and patriotic Frenchmen by the events of 1940." - D. W. Brogan, Spectator </p></p><p></p><h2>No Mexicans, Women, or Dogs Allowed: The Rise of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement</h2><p><p>Founded by Mexican American men in 1929, the League of United Latin-American Citizens (LULAC) has usually been judged according to Chicano nationalist standards of the late 1960s and 1970s. Drawing on extensive archival research, including the personal papers of Alonso S. Perales and Adela Sloss-Vento, No Mexicans, Women, or Dogs Allowed presents the history of LULAC in a new light, restoring its early twentieth-century context.</p><p>Cynthia Orozco also provides evidence that perceptions of LULAC as a petite bourgeoisie, assimilationist, conservative, anti-Mexican, anti-working class organization belie the realities of the group's early activism. Supplemented by oral history, this sweeping study probes LULAC's predecessors, such as the Order Sons of America, blending historiography and cultural studies. Against a backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, World War I, gender discrimination, and racial segregation, No Mexicans, Women, or Dogs Allowed recasts LULAC at the forefront of civil rights movements in America.</p></p><p>CYNTHIA E.

In <i>Where Is Ana Mendieta?</i> art historian Jane Blocker provides an in-depth critical analysis of Mendieta&#x2019;s diverse body of work. Although her untimely death in 1985 remains shrouded in controversy, her life and artistic legacy provide a unique vantage point from which to consider the history of performance art, installation, and earth works, as well as feminism, multiculturalism, and postmodernism. <br> Taken from banners carried in a 1992 protest outside the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the title phrase &#x201c;Where is Ana Mendieta?&#x201d; evokes not only the suspicious and tragic circumstances surrounding her death but also the conspicuous absence of women artists from high-profile exhibitions. Drawing on the work of such theorists as Judith Butler, Joseph Roach, Edward Said, and Homi Bhabha, Blocker discusses the power of Mendieta&#x2019;s earth-and-body art to alter, unsettle, and broaden the terms of identity itself. She shows how Mendieta used exile as a discursive position from which to disrupt dominant categories, analyzing as well Mendieta&#x2019;s use of mythology and anthropology, the ephemeral nature of her media, and the debates over her ethnic, gender, and national identities. <br> As the first major critical examination of this enigmatic artist&#x2019;s work, <i>Where Is Ana Mendieta?</i> will interest a broad audience, particularly those involved with the production, criticism, theory, and history of contemporary art. <p></p><p></p></p><p>&#34;This book offers a more rigorous historical and cultural analysis than earlier texts on Ana Mendieta. It adds usefully to one&#39;s understanding of Mendieta&#39;s work and will contribute to her insertion into history.&#34;--Mira Schor, author of &#34;Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture&#34;<p>Jane Blocker is Assistant Professor of Art History at Georgia State University.</p></p><h2>Library of Guitar Classics (Library of Series)</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Now, the beloved ninety-two-year-old, author of classics such as <em>Venice</em> and <em>Trieste</em>, embarks on an entirely new literary enterprise&#x2015;a collection of daily diaries, penned over the course of a single year. Ranging widely from the idyllic confines of her North Wales home, Morris offers diverse sallies on her preferred form of exercises (walking briskly), her frustration at not recognizing a certain melody humming in her head (Beethoven&#x2019;s Path�tique, incidentally), her nostalgia for small-town America, as well as intimate glimpses into her home life.</p><p>With insightful quips on world issues, including Britain&#x2019;s &#x201c;special relationship&#x201d; with the United States and the #MeToo movement, <em>In My Mind&#x2019;s Eye</em> will charm old and new Jan Morris fans alike.</p> Frontispiece</p><p>Born in 1926, Jan Morris is the author of such classics as the Pax Britannica trilogy and The World, among many others. She lives in Wales.&#x201c;<em>In My Mind&#x2019;s Eye</em> &#x2015; a collection of mini-essays, written one per day over the course of many months &#x2015; reveals that her writing is just as elegant and erudite, and her mind just as supple, playful, curious, rigorous, humorous and surprising as ever.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sarah Lyall, <i>New York Times</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;&#x201c;[Morris] is the same age as Queen Elizabeth II and like that remarkable monarch she still seems, in her early 90s, to be completely engaged with the world, understanding of its foibles and appreciative of what life has to offer.... Reading these beautifully written pages, one is struck by the gentle note of lament they host.... In My Mind&#x2019;s Eye is a lovely book, halfway between a diary and a volume of brief essays, a book that has a gentle, haunting tone. It will remind us of what a good, wise and witty companion Jan Morris has been for so many readers for so long.&#x201d;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alexander McCall Smith, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The most purely charming thing I have read so far in 2019 is Jan Morris&#x2019;s <em>In My Mind&#x2019;s Eye</em>....

[S]o charming, so endearing, such an antidote to boredom.&#x201d;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Constance Grady, <i>Vox</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is vintage Morris &#x2013; the mundane mingling with the majestic in a casual embrace, a regular walk quickened by Welsh military marches and stirring requiems. Like Michel de Montaigne, the seminal 16th-century essayist she deeply admires, Ms. Morris is a great expert at amusing herself, viewing her local stomping grounds as a lively source of theater.... Sublime.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Danny Heitman, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It is remarkable to be writing a book at 91, yet what grips is not so much her thoughts about the world (towards which she turns and turns away) but her sense of the rhythms of domestic life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A splendidly quirky confection that mixes the trivial with the serious, like life.... Morris has a gift for picking out what seems only in retrospect to be obvious. Like all good diaries, this one benefits from the strengths of the form: the possibility of being (or sounding) spontaneous and impressionistic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>Literary Review</i> (UK)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In committing her ruminations to 320 entertaining pages, Morris creates a captivating image of a delightfully dotty elderly lady.... After closing the book, I felt bereft of Morris&#x2019;s company and her chummy, conversational prose style.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Susan Flockhart, <i>Glasgow Sunday Herald</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Morris is one of Britain&#x2019;s greatest living writers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>The Times</i> (UK)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;At the start of her 10th decade, Jan Morris was asked to write a diary of her thoughts. Day-to-day observations and experiences, mostly light, some weighty, others the expected ruminations of a versatile British author long celebrated for her histories and travel writing. Morris, now 92, undertook the task with some trepidation, not because of her age &#x2015; she is doing quite nicely, thank you &#x2015; but out of modesty: Why would anyone care? Well, we do. Especially when these brief, daily entries range so widely, from sharp, wistful or cranky to eccentric and grandmotherly.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bill Thomson, <i>The Post and Courier</i></strong></p><h2>The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols</h2><p><i>The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols </i>is a portal into the rich, multifaceted, and profound symbolism of Tibetan sacred art.

Li'l Dan finds the drumming so wonderful that he makes a drum for himself and learns to imitate the sounds around him. When the plantation is liberated by a troop of African-American Union soldiers, Dan is too con-fused to do anything but follow them. He becomes their mascot and, in the climax of the story, uses his drum to frighten away Confederate cavalry by imitating the sound of cannon fire. Renowned African-American artist Romare Bearden uses this simple, poignant story as the lynchpin for a won-derful series of mixed-media paintings, completed in 1983. Fluid lines drenched with color invite the reader to discover the emotion within the book. Young readers will be well served by the accompanying CD in which Maya Angelou's signature voice provides the perfect measured narration of Bearden's story, allowing children the opportunity to fully immerse them-selves in his art.

Before they were through, the Nazis had taken more than 20,000 paintings, sculptures, and drawings from France.<i>The Lost Museum</i> explores the Nazis' systematic confiscation of these artworks, focusing on the private collections of five families: Rothschild, Rosenberg, Bernheim-Jeune, David-Weill, and Schloss. The book is filled with private family photos of this art, some of which has never before been seen by the public, and it traces the fate of these works as they passed through the hands of top German officials, unscrupulous art dealers, and unwitting auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's.</p><p>Pillage is one of the traditional perks of warfare. But it took Adolf Hitler to systematize the decimation and despoiling of cultures, and it took Hector Feliciano seven years to track five famous art collections stolen by the Nazis. He uncovered not only Nazi schemes but also a well-oiled machine of collaborators, informants, moving companies, and neighbors, all with their fingers in the pie. <i>The Lost Museum</i> reads like a good detective story. Inspired by a fascination with the theft of five prominent Parisian Jewish families' art collections, it focuses on the beneficiaries of the thefts and justice for its victims. Filled with family photos of the art, some never before seen by the public, <i>The Lost Museum</i> tracks the pieces as they passed through the hands of German officials, unscrupulous art dealers, and unsuspecting auction houses. That the network was so deviously intricate illustrates the enormous challenge of restitution. <p> The relationship between Nazi higher-ups, keen to advance their own collections, and non-Jewish dealers bodes well for the Parisian art scene. A Picasso for a Titian; two classics for eleven late-19th-/early-20th-century moderns? Such wheeling and dealing reduces art to tug-of-war commodities, and Feliciano's <i>The Lost Museum</i> at times seems to question nothing less than what art serves, and who profits from it. If you like a good detective story and can tolerate the frustration of justice impaired by greed, then this thoroughly documented dark tale is for you.</p><b>Hector Feliciano</b> is editor-in-chief of World Media Network.

The Catholic Church values both Faith and Reason, and Catholicism has given rise to extraordinary ideas and whole schools of remarkable thought, not just in the distant past but throughout the troubled decades of the twentieth century.</p><p>Royal presents in a single volume a sweeping but readable account of how Catholic thinking developed in philosophy, theology, Scripture studies, culture, literature, and much more in the twentieth century. This involves great figures, recognized as such both inside and outside the Church, such as <b>Jacques Maritain, Bernard Lonergan, Joseph Pieper, Edith Stein, Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Romano Guardini, Karl Rahner, Henri du Lubac, Karol Wojtyla, Joseph Ratzinger, Hans Urs von Balthasar,Charles Peguy, Paul Claudel, George Bernanos, Francois Mauriac, G. K. Chesterton, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Christopher Dawson, Graham Greene, Sigrid Undset, J. R. R. Tolkien, Czeslaw Milosz</b>, and many more.</p><p>Royal argues that without rigorous thought, Catholicism &#x2013; however welcoming and nourishing it might be &#x2013; would become something like a doctor with a good bedside manner, but who knows little medicine. It has always been the aspiration of the Catholic tradition to unite emotion and intellect, action and contemplation. But unless we know what the tradition has already produced &#x2013; especially in the work of the great figures of the recent past &#x2013; we will not be able to answer the challenges that the modern world poses, or even properly recognize the true questions we face.</p><p>This is a reflective, non-polemical work that brings together various strands of Catholic thought in the twentieth century. A comprehensive guide to the recent past - and the future.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert Royal</b> is the president of the Faith &amp; Reason Institute in Washington DC and editor of the online column series The Catholic Thing. He is the author, editor, and translator of more than a dozen books, and he writes and speaks frequently on questions of culture, religion, and public life.

" --<strong>Francis J. Beckwith</strong>, Professor of Philosophy &amp; Church-State Studies, Baylor University<br><br>"A pivotal book. Royal shows how each generation in the great Catholic intellectual tradition processes down the centuries in millennial long conversations with those preceding them.&nbsp; This ongoing procession contributes to a vast and complex cathedral of mind and heart, far more enduring than those of stone, wherein human dignity is discovered to be a gift, a finite participation, in the very mystery of the Triune God." --<strong>Fr. Matthew Lamb</strong>, Professor of Theology, Ave Maria University<br><br>"This masterful&nbsp;book&nbsp;makes clear that the past&nbsp;century, for all its terrible horrors, was also a time of extraordinary Christian fruitfulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Royal is a cultural commentator with&nbsp;rare scholarly breadth and balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;His judgments regarding major 20th century theologians and theological movements should be required reading for all&nbsp;graduate students&nbsp;and seminarians.&nbsp;Royal is&nbsp;even more in his element when he assesses the great Catholic poets, historians, and novelists who&nbsp;graced the past century.&nbsp; This uplifting book comes as a much needed encouragement in&nbsp;the midst of the deepening&nbsp;storms of our own time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For if the twentieth century shows that where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more, surely this too will be the ultimate story of our&nbsp;own century.

Through a powerful combination of cultural analysis and memoir, this stunningly original book explores why cancer remains so confounding, despite the billions of dollars spent in the search for a cure. Amidst furious debates over its causes and treatments, scientists generate reams of data&#x2015;information that ultimately obscures as much as it clarifies. Award-winning anthropologist S. Lochlann Jain deftly unscrambles the high stakes of the resulting confusion. Expertly reading across a range of material that includes history, oncology, law, economics, and literature, Jain explains how a national culture that simultaneously aims to deny, profit from, and cure cancer entraps us in a state of paradox&#x2015;one that makes the world of cancer virtually impossible to navigate for doctors, patients, caretakers, and policy makers alike. This chronicle, burning with urgency and substance leavened with brio and wit, offers a lucid guide to understanding and navigating the quicksand of uncertainty at the heart of cancer. <i>Malignant</i> vitally shifts the terms of an epic battle we have been losing for decades: the war on cancer.</p><p>"The writing is marvelous and the scholarship is incredible -- but you aren't prepared for the disarming humor, or the delicate dissection of the psyche that Jain achieves.

Reverse mathematics is a new field that answers some old questions. In the two thousand years that mathematicians have been deriving theorems from axioms, it has often been asked: which axioms are needed to prove a given theorem? Only in the last two hundred years have some of these questions been answered, and only in the last forty years has a systematic approach been developed. In <i>Reverse Mathematics</i>, John Stillwell gives a representative view of this field, emphasizing basic analysis&#x2015;finding the &#x201c;right axioms&#x201d; to prove fundamental theorems&#x2015;and giving a novel approach to logic.</p><p>Stillwell introduces reverse mathematics historically, describing the two developments that made reverse mathematics possible, both involving the idea of arithmetization. The first was the nineteenth-century project of arithmetizing analysis, which aimed to define all concepts of analysis in terms of natural numbers and sets of natural numbers. The second was the twentieth-century arithmetization of logic and computation. Thus arithmetic in some sense underlies analysis, logic, and computation. Reverse mathematics exploits this insight by viewing analysis as arithmetic extended by axioms about the existence of infinite sets. Remarkably, only a small number of axioms are needed for reverse mathematics, and, for each basic theorem of analysis, Stillwell finds the &#x201c;right axiom&#x201d; to prove it.</p><p>By using a minimum of mathematical logic in a well-motivated way, <i>Reverse Mathematics</i> will engage advanced undergraduates and all mathematicians interested in the foundations of mathematics.</p></p><p><p>"Reverse mathematics is the mathematical logician's version of zoology or botany, a classification of mathematical theorems in terms of the strength of the axioms needed to prove them. Stillwell carefully situates the field in the broader context of the history of mathematics and its foundations, and does a fine job of making the whole endeavor accessible to a general mathematical audience."<b>--Jeremy Avigad, Carnegie Mellon University</b></p><p>"Filling an important niche, this book gives readers a good picture of the basics of reverse mathematics while suggesting several directions for further reading and study. It provides a context for the questions investigated by reverse mathematics and makes an extended argument for their significance within contemporary mathematical practice."<b>--Denis Hirschfeldt, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"Reverse mathematics is a major research direction in the foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic, and the insights obtained from reverse mathematics will interest a wide mathematically minded audience. Stillwell's book is self-contained and includes much background material in analysis, mathematical logic, combinatorics, and computability.

Yet as federal entitlement programs have grown, so too have their inefficiency and their cost. Neither tax revenues nor revenues generated by the national economy have been able to keep pace with their rising growth, bringing the national debt to a record peacetime level.</p> <p><i>The High Cost of Good Intentions</i> is the first comprehensive history of these federal entitlement programs. Combining economics, history, political science, and law, John F. Cogan reveals how the creation of entitlements brings forth a steady march of liberalizing forces that cause entitlement programs to expand. This process&#x2015;as visible in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as in the present day&#x2015;is repeated until benefits are extended to nearly all who could be considered eligible, and in turn establishes a new base for future expansions. His work provides a unifying explanation for the evolutionary path that nearly all federal entitlement programs have followed over the past two hundred years, tracing both their shared past and the financial risks they pose for future generations.</p></p><p><b>John F. Cogan</b> is the Leonard and Shirley Ely Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a faculty member in Stanford University's Public Policy Program."Finally someone has written a comprehensive history of America's efforts to help worthy groups of Americans: the elderly, the veteran, the less fortunate, and the very young. It is a history of ever more generous help to ever larger groups of people. You can agree or disagree with the merit of all these programs, but the cost is clear, and John Cogan shows why that cost has been either ignored or passed to future generations. The first step in fixing our entitlements is knowing their history. Cogan has now given us that history." (Bill Bradley <i>former U.S. Senator</i>)<br><br>"People often wonder how "the land of the free" acquired such a huge government that interferes with so many parts of our lives. Cogan has shown how that happened with entitlement programs, which are a huge part of government." (David R. Henderson <i><i>Regulation</i></i>)<br><br>"John F. Cogan handles the historical details of myriad social programs with considerable competence...This book covers subjects missing from the historical literature and generalizes across cases in useful ways. It will surely aid historians as they write about the modern welfare state."&#x2013;&#x2013;Edward D. Berkowitz, <i>Journal of American History</i><br><br>"[The book] will surely be of interest to academics, policymakers, and the members of the public with concern for the consequences of entitlements in the United States....[T]his is an easy book to recommend." (Bill Dupor <i><i>National Association for Business Economics</i></i>)<br><br>"John Cogan's book is an extensively researched and unbiased examination of how well-intentioned federal entitlement programs have evolved to become our country's number one fiscal challenge. His timely historical work deepens our understanding of how entitlement programs have grown into a costly burden that we ultimately cannot afford. Cogan makes clear that slowing the growth of entitlements is essential and that meeting this challenge is more about simple arithmetic than ideology. This book should be read by anyone interested in addressing our nation's fiscal and economic future, regardless of their political persuasion." (Sam Nunn <i>former U.S. Senator</i>)<br><br>"John Cogan thoroughly reviews one of the greatest challenges facing our country: the unsustainable growth of entitlement spending. He provides a comprehensive view of the issue by looking at the history, the evolution, and the daunting numbers. Cogan brings his extraordinary knowledge and background in economics, fiscal policy, health care, and Social Security to bear in this book to give the reader a full understanding of the roots and the extent of this growing problem that must be tackled." (Paul D. Ryan <i>Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives</i>)<br><br>"John Cogan lays bare the historic roots of the most important economic problem confronting American policymakers today: our runaway entitlements juggernaut. In the past half-century it has consumed ten percentage points of GDP, threatening productivity and economic growth. Cogan does not profess to have found an easy, short-term solution to runaway entitlement growth, but his masterful historical perspective does suggest what must be done sooner, rather than later. This is an important and splendid book." (Alan Greenspan <i>former Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States (1987&#x2013;2006) and former Chairman of the National Commission on Social Security Reform (1983)</i>)<br><br>"<i>The High Cost of Good Intentions</i> is a thoroughly researched, intellectually serious history of every major American entitlement program, from Revolutionary and Civil War pensions to Social Security, food stamps, and Obamacare. I know of no other work that offers such a comprehensive, readable history of the American welfare state." (R. Shep Melnick <i><i>Claremont Review of Books</i></i>)<br><br>"John Cogan gives us a blockbuster treatise on the history of federal entitlement programs. Part education, part cautionary tale, this richly researched book is above all a fascinating and insightful saga on how and why federal entitlements grow. A valuable guide to the future." (George P. Shultz, Distinguished Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University; former U.S. Secretary of State, Treasury <i>and Labor; and former Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget</i>)<br><br>"John Cogan's history of federal entitlement programs warns us that the ice we skate on has grown thinner decade by decade....Cogan provides useful case studies of measures that were sensible, self-limiting, and freedom-enhancing like the GI Bill, and current ones that grow as each benefit expansion leads to future entitlements that leave worthy original goals no longer recognizable."

Arguing that social classification is not a benign cultural act but a potent political one, Ann Laura Stoler&#x2019;s essays focus on parents and parenting, nursing mothers, servants, orphanages, and abandoned children to reveal why they were understood as so essential to imperial governance and why they have been so consistently absent from its historiography. In a new preface, Stoler takes up a broad range of problematics raised in the first edition, including the analytics of comparison, the treatment of the intimate, and more.</p><p>Praise for the first edition of <i>Carnal Knowledge and Imperial Power</i>:<br><br>&#x201c;Comprehensive, erudite, and compelling.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Journal of Modern History</i><br><br>&#x201c;Stoler presents a groundbreaking work that emanates from her empirical investigations of the European colonial experiences in Asia of the 19th and early 20th centuries. At the same time, she engages with cutting-edge discussions advanced by postcolonial theorists in recent years. By introducing the issues of race, sexuality, and intimacy into the study of colonialism, or the interactions of Europeans with the indigenous populations in their households and in their personal or sex lives, Stoler offers a fresh look at the European colonial experience, in which the line between the colonizers and the colonized becomes significantly blurred. This 'blurring,' or hybridity, is, of course, an important issue in postcolonial theory, yet Stoler's presentation reveals that this hybridity is not only a theoretical question, but also (though largely absent from the extant scholarship) a reflection of historical reality. Stoler shows that hybridization took place at the personal, quotidian level, where the Europeans interacted actively with the natives, and in the economic arena, where impoverished Europeans were forced to compete with locals for a good living in 'their' colonies.

Illuminating this elusive relationship, <i>Unequal under Law</i> lays out how decades of both manifest and latent racism helped shape a punitive U.S. drug policy whose onerous impact on racial minorities has been willfully ignored by Congress and the courts.<br> <br> Doris Marie Provine&#x2019;s engaging analysis traces the history of race in anti-drug efforts from the temperance movement of the early 1900s to the crack scare of the late twentieth century, showing how campaigns to criminalize drug use have always conjured images of feared minorities. Explaining how alarm over a threatening black drug trade fueled support in the 1980s for a mandatory minimum sentencing scheme of unprecedented severity, Provine contends that while our drug laws may no longer be racist by design, they remain racist <i>in</i> design. Moreover, their racial origins have long been ignored by every branch of government. This dangerous denial threatens our constitutional guarantee of equal protection of law and mutes a much-needed national discussion about institutionalized racism&#x2014;a discussion that <i>Unequal under Law</i> promises to initiate.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Doris Marie Provine</b> is the director of the School of Justice and Social Inquiry at Arizona State University.

The picture that emerges is one in which racial dynamics have always pervaded drug policy, from the criminalization of opium in the nineteenth century to Prohibition to the indefensible crack cocaine penalties of today.&nbsp;Only by understanding these basic functions can we assess the true implications of current drug policy and develop more constructive policy responses.&#x201d;&#x2014;Marc Mauer, executive director, The Sentencing Project</p> (Marc Mauer, executive director, The Sentencing Project)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Unequal under Law</i> is a masterful overview of the War on Drugs, drawing compelling historical continuity between different eras of U.S. policies toward &#x2018;mind-altering substances&#x2019; and vulnerable populations.

Epp <i>Law &amp; Politics Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Provine uses a social constructionist theoretical framework to logically, systematically, and thoroughly examine the history of drug control policy in the United States. Her book adds significantly to the literature in that it provides an historical, social, and political context to fully undersand the current war on drugs, its impact particularly on African American communities, and the apparent reluctance of the government to critically address America's approach to drug use." (Deidre M. Warren <i>Criminal Justice Review</i>)<br><br>"<i>Unequal under Law</i> is elegantly written and stands as an exemplar of the best of law and society scholarship. It offers a nuanced and kaleidoscopic examination of the persistence of racism in America and exposes the roles and responsibnilites of the law in sustaining racism. In this way, <i>Unequal under Law</i> also works as a case study of the capacity of law to achieve progressive social change, with important insights into the social and political conditions which constrain legal results. . . . A fascinating study demonstrating the importance and complexity of racial divisions in the United States. It is also a plea for understanding such divisions in an institutional and psychologically informed manner."

But there was no greater sense of winter desolation than on the north shore of Lake Superior, where the big water that looked like an ocean was forever pushing enormous blocks of sharded ice against one shore or another.</p><p>The past two weeks had been particularly cruel to the lake. A parade of low- pressure systems had stalled, battling each other for command of the winds, freezing the great body of water almost to the horizon line. It was profoundly disturbing to see something so powerful completely subdued, like King Kong in chains on a Broadwaystage.</p><p>Randy Coulter had a lot of empathy for the lake, because he knewwhat it felt like to be the helpless victim of a greater force, trappedby circumstances he was powerless to change. But that was the oldRandy&#x2014; the new, improved Randy finally had the power to makethings happen. And if he could muster the guts, he&#x2019;d make somethinghappen today.</p><p>The trail on the edge of the cliff provided spectacular winterscapeviews for the snowshoers and cross- country skiers who frequentedthe winter resorts along the shore, and their numbers were legion inthe week between Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s. City dwellers accustomedto the protective environment of crosswalks and guardrailsflocked to the north in a foolish fit of adventure, where you actuallyhad to rely on your own good sense instead of the nanny state tokeep you safe.</p><p>Randy slipped out of his snowshoes and off the groomed trail,testing each step toward the edge of the cliff with a pole to makesure there was frozen earth beneath the windswept snow. Thecloser he got to the lip of eternity, the colder the wind that blewon his face. He began to despair, thinking that no would- be athletewould venture out on such a day, when the barometer rose and thetemperatures plummeted. They were all inside their cozy cabins andresort rooms, frolicking in hot tubs or drinking in front of a fire,and Randy would be the only soul to see this cliff today.</p><p>He had to drop to the snow on his stomach to safely examine themagnificent sight over fifty feet below him. The shoreline bristledwith stalagmites of frozen water that vaulted upward from the shorelike monstrous icy teeth, just waiting for something substantial tognaw on. &#x201c;Beautiful,&#x201d; he whispered. </p><p> &#x201c;Hey. You okay?&#x201d; </p><p>Randy nearly tumbled over the edge at the sound of a male voicebehind him, and then looked over his shoulder and saw everythinghe would never be. From the logo on the Gore- Tex suit he knewimmediately that the man drove a foreign sports car and had lefta probably augmented blond woman back in his cabin, and for amoment he felt himself shrink away, curl inside himself, until heremembered the power. &#x201c;Thank God,&#x201d; he said, and the man&#x2019;s waxedbrows moved into a frown. </p><p> &#x201c;Are you hurt, buddy? How can I help?&#x201d; </p><p>Randy closed his eyes. &#x201c;I think there&#x2019;s a body down there,&#x201d; hewhispered, rising to his feet. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know what to do . . .&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;No, really.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Jesus Christ.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Do you have a cell phone?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Sure. Let me get a look first.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Okay, but be careful. It&#x2019;s a little slick out here near the edge.&#x201d;The man removed his snowshoes, moved cautiously toward theedge, and peered over. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;You have to come further this way. Those ice spikes block theview . . . oh, man, this is horrible, I&#x2019;ve never seen anything likethis . . .&#x201d; Randy felt the man&#x2019;s hand come down firmly on his shoulder.Oddly, he found the touch comforting. </p><p> &#x201c;Take it easy, buddy. Just relax, take a breath. It&#x2019;s down there?&#x201d;Randy didn&#x2019;t have to fake the tears. They came on their own, andhe couldn&#x2019;t imagine why. &#x201c;Right . . . down . . . there . . .&#x201d; he pointed,and when the man leaned forward to follow his finger, Randy lockedhis knees and braced his legs and pushed against the man&#x2019;s backwith all the strength he had. </p><p>The wind carried away the prolonged scream as Randy just stoodthere, looking out toward the horizon, his face expressionless. Itmight have been seconds or hours when he finally fell to his stomachagain and peered over the edge. </p><p>It looked like Mr. Gore- Tex was humping one of the ice stalagmites,and Randy thought that was pretty funny.</p><p> &#x201c;I told you there was a body down there,&#x201d; he whispered, thenpulled a tiny video camera out of his parka pocket and hit the zoombutton. </p><p><b> Chapter 1</b></p><p>Alan squinted hard at his three faces in the tiara&#x2019;s bathroom mirror, trying without any real success to bring a singlereflection into focus. But even with his vision swimming and pixilatedby vodka, he could see enough to know he looked like a Picassoportrait of Liza Minnelli. His false eyelashes were drooping liketired spiders, spinning crazy webs of mascara down his cheeks, andhis smeared lips looked slightly askew, a scarlet counterbalance forhis cockeyed wig that was tipping to the opposite side. </p><p>His billowy white dress had also suffered the indignity of histwelve- hour party day, and it was shedding pearls like a vomitingoyster. </p><p>He cringed as he tried to tease out snippets of the evening fromhis memory, but there were a lot of black spots in the matrix. SweetJesus Lord Almighty, he was drunk. How many martinis had hehad? Two at home, another four or five at Camilla&#x2019;s place for sure,and then there had been an unrelenting succession of those disgusting,tragically pink cocktails here at the club, pushed on him by thenew Dominican bartender who&#x2019;d been so guileless in sharing thevarious intimate locations of his body piercings. </p><p>The thought of needles being poked into certain sensitive areasof a male&#x2019;s anatomy sent his stomach into turmoil, and he leanedover the sink and splashed cold water on his face until the nauseasubsided. </p><p>When he finally felt sturdy enough, he pushed himself into anupright position and aimed his compass for the nearest exit. Thenight was young, there were still some A- list parties he was planningto attend, and he needed to sober up before he did, especially if hewas going to perform. Fortunately, Camilla had given him the key toher condo, which was just a few blocks away if he went as the crowflies and took the riverside walking path. He&#x2019;d take a shower, drinksome juice, and he&#x2019;d be up and running again just in time for thedrag show. </p><p>It was never easy negotiating the path along the Mississippi infour- inch stilettos, even with your sense of equilibrium intact; andit was harder still when you were wearing a fabulous pair of Dolce&amp; Gabbanas you just had to have because they were fifty percent offat Neiman&#x2019;s, even though they were a size too big. He&#x2019;d stuffed thetoes with cotton balls and had doubled up some duct tape and put itin the heels, because dancing to &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Raining Men&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t exactly aminuet, and he needed the extra security. But he was still slipping inand out of them as he half- careened, half- bulldozed down the path,and at one point, he stumbled, fell, and came to lying in a nest ofdamp, putrid- smelling weeds so close to the river, he could hear thehiss of water in his ears. </p><p>He could also hear Wild Jim&#x2019;s psychotic, drunken rants echoingin the darkness: &#x201c;Crazy faggot! Crazy faggot, crazy queen, fell downand broke his crown!&#x201d; </p><p>Wild Jim was a fixture along this stretch of the Mississippi, andthe locals who lived around here knew him every bit as well as thecops did. He was clearly on a superior bender of unknown origintonight, like almost every other night, and in that regard, the two ofthem had a lot in common. In fact, Alan felt strangely comforted bythe familiar presence, as annoying as it was. </p><p> &#x201c;Yoo- hoo! Jimmy!&#x201d; he called in his best soprano lilt. &#x201c;Where areyou? Come here and help Mama up!&#x201d; </p><p>Wild Jim answered with a grunting salvo of unintelligible expletivesfrom somewhere above him on the embankment. </p><p> &#x201c;Puh- leeze, Jimmy,&#x201d; Alan needled. &#x201c;Come help your mama.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Stop talking shit. You crazy faggots are messing up my river andalways talking shit.&#x201d; </p><p>Alan giggled and stared up at the stars, wondering if he&#x2019;d everbe able to muster the strength to pull himself up. And in truth, hewasn&#x2019;t sure he wanted to, at least not yet. It did smell down here,and the ground was damp, but it was surprisingly peaceful in thislittle hollow where the riverbanks absorbed the urban cacophony ofthe streets above. If Wild Jim would only shut up, he might actuallyconsider taking a little nap right here. </p><p>He had no idea how much time had passed before he finallystruggled to his feet, and as he did, he heard the rustle of grass comingfrom somewhere behind him, drawing closer. He hadn&#x2019;t everexpected that Wild Jim would actually show himself&#x2014; he had a bigmouth, but he usually stayed out of sight. </p><p>It was a delicious, naughty surprise to feel two powerful armsscoop him up like a bride. Not a common scenario for gay men meetingby the river for a one- time, anonymous assignation, which wasthe saddest thing about being a queen. Normally there were no realkings in the circle; no take- you- down- and- have- their- way- with- youromantic heroes, and Alan&#x2019;s girlish heart had always pined for that.How lovely that at last he was the romantic heroine of his imagination.Too bad he was so wasted he&#x2019;d probably never remember anyof this. </p><p>He heard the splash when his hero first stepped into the river,but didn&#x2019;t process the implications until he felt himself being loweredinto the water. His first thought was for his shoes; his secondfor his dress; but both of those major tragedies were blasted fromthe ruins of his mind when the man pushed him to the bottomand pinned him there. Alan held his breath dutifully, looking upthrough the water, waiting to see what came next in this kinkiest ofall encounters. </p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t very deep this close to the shore; maybe five inches overhis face.

Calder lives in Paris where she works as a correspondent for <i>Vogue Entertaining &amp; Travel</i>, and where she taught herself to cook the same way most of us learned--by feeding herself and her friends. Who among us can't relate to her description of Mushroom Toasts: "It's a starter when other people are around, but if I'm alone, I just tilt the whole pan into a high, rubbly heap on my plate, dig in, and call it dinner." And how many of us recognize ourselves when she confesses of Burgundy Eggs (a heavenly concoction of eggs poached in red wine served with a hearty sauce that she adores): "Oh, how I did not want to make these when I first came to France; I thought nothing on earth sounded so vile."<p> Almost all of Calder's recipes are barely a page long, and that's only because of those frank and funny introductions. Her recipes for dishes such as Camembert Salmon, Scallops in Velvet, and The Lemon Tart of My Dreams, are simple, approachable, and manageable. The ingredients are easy to find, and she's always suggesting options. Calder's is a sunny and welcome addition to the list of French cookbooks already out there, and happily, chefs of any skill level will enjoy her company in the kitchen. <i>--Leora Y.

A wealthy man retired to the Michigan woods narrates the tale of a younger man decivilized by brain damage. A Michigan Indian wanders Los Angeles, hobnobbing with starlets and screenwriters while he tracks an ersatz Native-American activist who stole his bearskin. An aging "alpha canine," the author of three dozen throwaway biographies, eats dinner with the ex-wife of his overheated youth, and must confront the man he used to be.</p><p>At 67, Norman Arnz is well aware of his narrative limitations: "I dare say that no one understands more than the part of the story that is directly contiguous to them." Yet the conjunction of placement and perception is crucial to both him and his tale. The title novella in Jim Harrison's <i>The Beast God Forgot to Invent</i> takes the form of Arnz's written report explaining the death by drowning of a lifetime resident of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Slow, different, backward--Joe Lacort had been labeled all these and more since a car accident illustrated "the Newtonian principle that an object in motion (your head) tends to remain in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced or unequal force (in Joe's case, a massive gray beech tree)."<p> What Arnz realizes, to his dismay and envy, is that this man "had crossed over a line into an <i>otherness</i> of perception that was unavailable to the rest of us," that his "sense of time has become hopelessly round while ours is linear." Joe's story, told as Arnz circles back and back, questing for original cause, is the story of mapping oneself and one's place in a profoundly captivating--and dislocating--universe. "Maybe," he ponders, "the world really doesn't look like the one I've been seeing all along. That was one of the questions Joe offered." These questions, and answers, are relayed by an astonishing voice: Harrison gives his narrator an oddly intoxicating blend of E.B. White's wry irony and perfectly matter-of-fact precision and Humbert Humbert's solipsistic bravura and edgy suspiciousness. </p><p> And the other two novellas are equally engaging. In "Westward Ho," a Michigan Native American finds himself on a quixotic quest through Los Angeles in pursuit of a stolen bearskin. An assortment of jaded Sancho Panzas aid (I use the term loosely) Brown Dog in his search. Sentimental without being trite, the story soars easily above potential "small-town Indian, big city" limitations. "I Forgot to Go to Spain" returns to a first-person narrator, a glib biographer suspicious that "the language I was using to describe myself to myself might be radically askew."</p><p> Harrison is a rare beast, an author whose ideas are at once grand and simple. His prose is so tantalizingly <i>right</i> that you might be tempted to gather his sentences and fling yourself into their midst, just for the sheer pleasure of it all. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Like his other fiction, Harrison's fourth volume of novellas takes hold of you through the sweetly intoxicating influence and power of his narrative voices, from which strong characterizations flow. As usual, he blends nature with culture, more often than not folding the latter into the former in subtle ways that show us that no matter how hard we try we just can't divorce ourselves from the big picture. The title novella, set in Michigan, takes the form of a written report to a coroner in which a wealthy 67-year-old man--a cultured and savvy narrator who has vacationed in Michigan's Upper Peninsula since childhood--describes events leading to the drowning of his younger friend, Joe. Joe, himself, had been a successful businessman until a car accident and ensuing brain damage had outwardly "enfeebled" him, though in reality turned him more primal. The narrative is far more than a report, as Joe's actions prompt the narrator to examine his own life and his philosophy toward life. In "Westward Ho," a Native American (from Michigan) tracks a double-dealing friend to L.A. to recover his stolen bearskin, which holds sentimental clan value. Brown Dog's adventures in Lotus Land are helped along by characters who are as jaded, eccentric, and cynical as any you're likely to come across this side of Nathanael West. "I Forgot to Go to Spain" is a return to the first-person narrator, which Harrison employs so well. This time the protagonist is a middle-aged writer of knockoff biographies that have made him a lot of money but also sidetracked him from literature--and a trip to an idealized Spain that he had dreamed of since college. It's familiar theme is rescued by a glib narrator unafraid to reveal the contradictions and errors of his thinking, and whose leap into the past (reminiscences and a reunion with an ex-wife) clears a bold path for his future. The novella has reemerged over the past few years, and these tales prove that Jim Harrison is a master of the genre. <i>Frank Caso</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She searched the shadows that surrounded them, briefly looking up at the stars, bright as diamonds against the black sky.</p><p>Squeezing her eyes shut, she prayed to the ancient sorceress. <i>Please, Eva, give me the magic I need tonight to find her.</i></p><p>When she opened her eyes, fear shot through her. On the branch of a tree a dozen paces away sat a golden hawk.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re watching us,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;They know what we&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d;</p><p>Sabina flicked a glance at the hawk. &#x201c;We need to move. Now. There&#x2019;s no time to waste.&#x201d;</p><p>Keeping her face turned away from the hawk, Jana pushed away from the safety of the wall to follow her sister to the heavy oak and iron door of the villa. Sabina pressed her hands against it, channeling the magic that had been strengthened by the blood they&#x2019;d spilled earlier. Jana noticed that Sabina&#x2019;s fingernails still bore traces of red in the cuticles, and she shuddered, remembering. Sabina&#x2019;s hands began to glow with amber light. A moment later, the door disintegrated into sawdust. Wood was no barricade against earth magic.</p><p>Sabina sent a victorious smile over her shoulder. Blood now trickled from her nose.</p><p>At her sister&#x2019;s gasp, Sabina&#x2019;s grin faded. She wiped it away and entered the large home. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t nothing. Using too much of this temporarily enhanced magic could harm them. Could kill them if they weren&#x2019;t careful.</p><p>But Sabina Mallius was not known to be the cautious one. She hadn&#x2019;t paused earlier tonight in using her beauty to lead the unsuspecting man from the tavern to his fate, while Jana had hesitated far too long before her sharp blade finally found its mark in his heart.</p><p>Sabina was strong, passionate, and completely fearless. Heart in throat as she followed Sabina inside, Jana wished she could be more like her older sister. But she&#x2019;d always been the careful one. The planner. The one who&#x2019;d seen the signs in the stars because she&#x2019;d studied the night skies all her life.</p><p>The prophesied child had been born and she was here in this large and luxurious villa&#x2014;built of sturdy stone and wood compared to the small, poorer straw and mud cottages in the village nearby.</p><p>Jana was certain this was the right place.</p><p>She was knowledge. Sabina was action. Together they were unstoppable</p><p>Sabina cried out as she turned the corner of the hallway up ahead. Jana quickened her pace, her heart pounding. In the dark hallway, lit only by wall-set torches that flickered their meager light on the stone walls, a guard had her sister by her throat.</p><p>Jana didn&#x2019;t think. She acted.</p><p>Thrusting out her hands, she summoned air magic. The guard lost his grip and flew back from Sabina, slamming into the wall behind her hard enough to crush his bones. He crumpled to the ground in a heap.</p><p>Sharp pain sliced through Jana&#x2019;s head, agonizing enough to make her whimper. She wiped at the warm, thick blood that now gushed from under her nose. Her hand trembled.</p><p>Sabina gingerly touched her injured throat. &#x201c;Thank you, sister.&#x201d;</p><p>This fresh blood magic helped speed their steps and clear their vision in the darkness of the unfamiliar, narrow stone hallways. But it wouldn&#x2019;t last long.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d; Sabina demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Close.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trusting you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The child is here. I know she is.&#x201d; They proceeded a few steps more down the dark hallway.</p><p>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; Jana stopped outside an unlocked door.</p><p>She pushed it open and the sisters moved toward the ornately carved wooden cradle inside the room. They looked down at the baby, swaddled in a soft rabbit&#x2019;s fur coverlet. Her skin was pale white with a healthy, rosy glow to her chubby cheeks.</p><p>Jana adored her instantly. The first smile she&#x2019;d been capable of for days blossomed on her face. &#x201c;Beautiful girl,&#x201d; she whispered, reaching into the cradle to gently pick up the newborn.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re certain it&#x2019;s her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; More than anything else in her seventeen years of life, Jana was positive of this. The child she held in her arms, this small, beautiful baby with sky-blue eyes and a fuzz of hair that would one day be black as a raven&#x2019;s wing, was the one prophesied to possess the magic necessary to find the Kindred&#x2014;four objects that contained the source of all <i>elementia</i>, elemental magic. Earth and water, fire and air.</p><p>The child&#x2019;s magic would be that of a sorceress, not a common witch like Jana and her sister. The first in a thousand years, since Eva herself had lived and breathed. There would be no need for blood or death to play any part in this child&#x2019;s magic.</p><p>Jana had seen her birth in the stars. Finding this child was her destiny.</p><p>&#x201c;Put my daughter down,&#x201d; a voice snarled from the shadows. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hurt her.&#x201d;</p><p>Jana spun around, clutching the infant to her chest. Her eyes fell on the dagger the woman pointed toward them. Its sharp edge glinted in the candlelight. Her heart sank. This was the moment she&#x2019;d been dreading, had prayed wouldn&#x2019;t come to pass.</p><p>Sabina&#x2019;s eyes flashed. &#x201c;Hurt her? That&#x2019;s not what we plan to do at all. You don&#x2019;t even know what she is, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>The woman&#x2019;s brows drew together with confusion, but fury hardened her gaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill you before I allow you to leave this room with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No&#x201d;&#x2014;Sabina raised her hands&#x2014;&#x201c;you won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>The mother&#x2019;s eyes grew wide and her mouth opened, gasping. She couldn&#x2019;t breathe&#x2014;Sabina was blocking the flow of air to her lungs. Jana turned away, face screwed up in misery. It was over in a moment. The woman&#x2019;s body fell to the ground, still twitching but lifeless, as the sisters sidestepped her and fled the room.</p><p>Jana gathered her loose cloak around the baby to hide her as they left the villa and ran into the forest. Sabina&#x2019;s nose bled profusely now from using so much destructive magic. Blood dripped to the snow-covered ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Too much,&#x201d; Jana whispered as their steps finally slowed. &#x201c;Too much death tonight. I hate it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She wouldn&#x2019;t have let us take her any other way. Let me see her.&#x201d;</p><p>Feeling oddly reluctant, Jana held the baby out.</p><p>Sabina took her and studied the child&#x2019;s face in the darkness. Her gaze flicked to Jana and she gave her sister a wicked grin. &#x201c;We did it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jana felt a sudden rush of excitement, despite the difficulties they&#x2019;d faced. &#x201c;We did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were incredible. I wish I could have visions like you do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only with great effort and sacrifice can I have them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all a great effort and sacrifice.&#x201d; Sabina&#x2019;s voice twisted with sudden disdain. &#x201c;Too much of it. But for this child, one day magic will be so easy. I envy her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll raise her together.

I&#x2019;ll take her from here.&#x201d;</p><p>Jana frowned. &#x201c;What? Sabina, I thought we agreed to make all decisions together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not this one. I have other plans for the child.&#x201d; Her expression hardened. &#x201c;And apologies, sister, but they don&#x2019;t include you.&#x201d;</p><p>Staring into Sabina&#x2019;s suddenly cold eyes, Jana at first didn&#x2019;t feel the sharp tip of the dagger sink into her chest. She gasped as the pain began to penetrate.</p><p>They&#x2019;d shared every day, every dream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;every secret.</p><p>However, it would appear, not <i>every</i> secret. This was not something Jana would have ever thought to try to foresee.</p><p>&#x201c;Why would you betray me like this?&#x201d; she managed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my <i>sister</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Sabina wiped away the blood that still trickled from her nose. &#x201c;For love.&#x201d;</p><p>When she yanked out the blade, Jana collapsed to her knees on the frozen ground.</p><p>Without a backward glance, Sabina swiftly walked away with the child and was soon swallowed by the dark forest.</p><p>Jana&#x2019;s vision dimmed and her heart slowed. She watched as the hawk she&#x2019;d seen earlier flew away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;leaving her to die alone.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>PAELSIA</p><p>SIXTEEN YEARS LATER</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Alife without wine and beauty isn&#x2019;t worth living. Don&#x2019;t you agree, princess?&#x201d; Aron slung his arm around Cleo&#x2019;s shoulders as the group of four walked along the dusty, rocky country path.</p><p>They&#x2019;d been in port for less than two hours and he was already drunk, a fact not unduly startling when it came to Aron.</p><p>Cleo&#x2019;s glance fell on their accompanying palace guard. His eyes flashed with displeasure at Aron&#x2019;s proximity to the princess of Auranos. But the guard&#x2019;s concern wasn&#x2019;t necessary. Despite the fancy jeweled dagger Aron always wore on a sheath hanging from his belt, he was no more dangerous than a butterfly. A drunk butterfly.</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more,&#x201d; she said, lying only a little.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we almost there?&#x201d; Mira asked. The beautiful girl with long, dark, reddish hair and smooth, flawless skin was both Cleo&#x2019;s friend and her older sister&#x2019;s lady-in-waiting. When Emilia decided to stay home due to a sudden headache, she&#x2019;d insisted that Mira accompany Cleo on this trip. Once the ship arrived in the harbor, a dozen of their friends chose to remain comfortably on board while Cleo and Mira joined Aron on his journey to a nearby village to find the &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; bottle of wine. The palace wine cellars were stocked with thousands of bottles of wine from both Auranos and Paelsia, but Aron had heard of a particular vineyard whose output was supposedly unparalleled. At his request, Cleo booked one of her father&#x2019;s ships and invited many of their friends on the trip to Paelsia expressly in search of his ideal bottle</p><p>&#x201c;That would be a question for Aron. He&#x2019;s the one leading this particular quest.&#x201d; Cleo drew her fur-lined velvet cloak closer to block out the chill of the day. While the ground was clear, a few light snowflakes drifted across their rock-strewn path. Paelsia was farther north than Auranos, but the temperature here surprised her nonetheless. Auranos was warm and temperate, even in the bleakest winter months, with rolling green hills, sturdy olive trees, and acres upon acres of rich, temperate farmland. Paelsia, by contrast, seemed dusty and gray as far as the eye could see.</p><p>&#x201c;Almost there?&#x201d; Aron repeated. &#x201c;Almost there? Mira, my peach, all good things come to those who wait. Remember that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My lord, I&#x2019;m the most patient person I know. But my feet hurt.&#x201d; She tempered the complaint with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful day and I&#x2019;m lucky enough to be accompanied by two gorgeous girls. We must give thanks to the goddess for the splendor we&#x2019;ve been greeted with here.&#x201d;</p><p>Watching the guard, Cleo saw him briefly roll his eyes. When he noticed that she had seen him, he didn&#x2019;t immediately look away as any other guard might. He held her gaze with a defiance that intrigued her. She realized she hadn&#x2019;t seen&#x2014;or, at least, noticed&#x2014;this guard before today.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; she addressed him.</p><p>&#x201c;Theon Ranus, your highness.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Theon, do you have anything to add to our discussion about how far we&#x2019;ve walked this afternoon?&#x201d;</p><p>Aron chortled and swigged from his flask.</p><p>&#x201c;No, princess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised, since you are the one who&#x2019;ll be required to carry the cases of wine back to the ship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my duty and honor to serve you.&#x201d;</p><p>Cleo considered him for a moment. His hair was the color of dark bronze, his skin tanned and unlined. He looked as if he could be one of her rich friends waiting on the ship rather than a uniformed guard her father had insisted accompany them on this journey.</p><p>Aron must have been thinking the exact same thing. &#x201c;You look young for a palace guard.&#x201d; His words slurred together drunkenly as he regarded Theon with a squint. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be much older than I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m eighteen, my lord.&#x201d;</p><p>Aron snorted. &#x201c;I stand corrected. You are much older than me. Vastly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By one year,&#x201d; Cleo reminded him.</p><p>&#x201c;A year can be a blissful eternity.&#x201d; Aron grinned. &#x201c;I plan to cling to my youth and lack of responsibility for the year I have left.&#x201d;</p><p>Cleo ignored Aron, for the guard&#x2019;s name now rang a bell in her mind. She&#x2019;d overheard her father as he exited one of his council meetings briefly discuss the Ranus family. Theon&#x2019;s father had died only a week ago&#x2014;thrown from a horse. His neck had broken instantly.</p><p>&#x201c;My sympathies for the loss of your father,&#x201d; she said with sincerity. &#x201c;Simon Ranus was well respected as my father&#x2019;s personal bodyguard.&#x201d;</p><p>Theon nodded stiffly. &#x201c;It was a job he did with great pride. And one I hope to have the honor to be considered for when King Corvin chooses his replacement.&#x201d; Theon&#x2019;s brows drew together as if he hadn&#x2019;t expected her to know of his father&#x2019;s death. An edge of grief slid behind his dark eyes. &#x201c;Thank you for your kind words, your highness.&#x201d;</p><p>Aron audibly snorted and Cleo shot him a withering look.</p><p>&#x201c;Was he a good father?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The very best. He taught me everything I know from the moment I could hold a sword.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded sympathetically. &#x201c;Then his knowledge will continue to live on through you.&#x201d;</p><p>Now that the young guard&#x2019;s dark good looks had caught her attention, she found it increasingly difficult to return her gaze to Aron, whose slight frame and pale skin spoke of a life spent indoors. Theon&#x2019;s shoulders were broad, his arms and chest muscled, and he filled out the dark blue palace guard uniform better than she ever would have imagined possible.</p><p>Guiltily, she forced herself to return her attention to her friends. &#x201c;Aron, you have another half hour before we head back to the ship. We&#x2019;re keeping the others waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>Auranians loved a good party, but they weren&#x2019;t known for their endless patience. However, since they&#x2019;d been brought to the Paelsian docks by her father&#x2019;s ship, they&#x2019;d have to keep waiting until Cleo was ready to leave.</p><p>&#x201c;The market we&#x2019;re going to is up ahead,&#x201d; Aron said, gesturing. Cleo and Mira looked and saw a cluster of wooden stalls and colorful worn tents, perhaps another ten minutes&#x2019; walk. It was the first sign of people they had seen since they&#x2019;d passed a ragged band of children clustered around a fire an hour ago. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll soon see it was well worth the trip.&#x201d;</p><p>Paelsian wine was said to be a drink worthy of the goddess. Delicious, smooth, without equal in any other land, its effects did not lead to illness or headaches the next day, no matter how much was consumed. Some said that there was strong earth magic at work in the Paelsian soil and in the grapes themselves to make them so perfect in a land that held so many other imperfections.</p><p>Cleo wasn&#x2019;t planning to sample it. She didn&#x2019;t drink wine anymore&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t for many months. Before that, she&#x2019;d consumed more than her share of Auranian wine, which didn&#x2019;t taste much better than vinegar. But people&#x2014;at least, Cleo&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t drink it for the taste; they drank it for the intoxicating results, the feeling of not a care in the world. Such a feeling, without an anchor to hold one close to shore, could lead one to drift into dangerous territory. And Cleo wasn&#x2019;t in any hurry to sip anything stronger than water or peach ...</p></p><h2>History of the Peloponnesian War, Volume I: Books 1-2 (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>Thucydides of Athens, one of the greatest of historians, was born about 471 BCE. He saw the rise of Athens to greatness under the inspired leadership of Pericles. In 430, the second year of the Peloponnesian War, he caught and survived the horrible plague which he described so graphically. Later, as general in 423 he failed to save Amphipolis from the enemy and was disgraced. He tells about this, not in volumes of self-justification, but in one sentence of his history of the war&#x2015;that it befell him to be an exile for twenty years. He then lived probably on his property in Thrace, but was able to observe both sides in certain campaigns of the war, and returned to Athens after her defeat in 404. He had been composing his famous history, with its hopes and horrors, triumphs and disasters, in full detail from first-hand knowledge of his own and others.</p><p>The war was really three conflicts with one uncertain peace after the first; and Thucydides had not unified them into one account when death came sometime before 396. His history of the first conflict, 431&#x2013;421, was nearly complete; Thucydides was still at work on this when the war spread to Sicily and into a conflict (415&#x2013;413) likewise complete in his awful and brilliant record, though not fitted into the whole. His story of the final conflict of 413&#x2013;404 breaks off (in the middle of a sentence) when dealing with the year 411. So his work was left unfinished and as a whole unrevised. Yet in brilliance of description and depth of insight this history has no superior.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Thucydides is in four volumes.</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Once the rules of the game are known, there not only comes the urge to create with needle and thread, but a knowledge which enables the better appreciation of the old masterpieces, as well as those produced in our own day." With this ambition in mind, Miss Thomas takes the reader on an encyclopedic tour of the world of needle art. In an effort to develop a full appreciation of embroidery, she explores virtually every technique &#x2014; indeed, she covers just about everything that can be done to fabric with a needle and thread, including Appliqu�, Cutwork, Patchwork, Assisi cross stitch, Filet darning, Quilting, Blackwork, Hardanger embroidery, Smocking, Broderie Anglaise, Jacobean embroidery, and Tapestry.<br>Over 30 different types of traditional needlework are introduced and explained in this book. Miss Thomas describes each technique, including historical background, then explains how each is worked. For further clarity, over 400 helpful illustrations are provided, including examples of "old masterpieces." The final chapter of the book offers technical hints and advice on materials and equipment.<br>Experienced and novice needleworkers alike will appreciate Miss Thomas's treatment of the needlecraft arts both as an exploratory survey of their vast range and as a comprehensive reference work.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Murder on the Ballarat Train (Miss Fisher&#39;s Murder Mysteries, 3)</h2><p><p><strong>Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, now streaming on Netflix, starring Essie Davis as the honourable Phryne Fisher</strong></p><p>"Greenwood's stories are brief, but she holds her own, writing well-thought-out plots starring the intelligent, sexy, liberated, and wealthy Phryne." &#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em></p><p>When the 1920s' most glamorous lady detective, the Honourable Miss Phryne Fisher, arranges to go to Ballarat for the week, she eschews the excitement of her red Hispano-Suiza racing car for the sedate safety of the train.

She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>On the train to Ballarat, 1920s Australian feminist flapper and private investigator Phryne Fisher wakes up to the smell of chloroform. She saves all her fellow passengers, except an old, cantankerous woman whose body is found at the side of the train tracks. While investigating the murder for the woman's daughter, Phryne also takes in an amnesiac waif on the train who has no knowledge of why she is traveling in the opposite direction of her ticket. Compared with other mysteries, Greenwood's stories are brief, but she holds her own, writing well-thought-out plots starring the intelligent, sexy, liberated, and wealthy Phryne.

What we need is the willingness to just be with our experiences&#x2014;whether they are painful or pleasing&#x2014;opening ourselves to the reality of our lives without trying to fix or change anything. But doing this requires that we confront our most deeply rooted fears and assumptions in order to gradually become free of the constrictions and suffering they create. Then we can awaken to the loving-kindness that is at the heart of our being. <br><br>While many books aspire to bring meditation into everyday experience, <i>Being Zen </i>gives us practical ways to actually do it, introducing techniques that enable the reader to foster qualities essential to continued spiritual awakening. Topics include how to cultivate: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Perseverance</i>: staying with anger, fear, and other distressing emotions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Stillness</i>: abiding with chaotic experiences without becoming overwhelmed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Clarity</i>: seeing through the conditioned beliefs and fears that "run" us. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; <i>Direct</i> <i>experience</i>: encountering the physical reality of the present moment&#x2014;even when that moment is exactly where we don't want to be.<br>Like Pema Ch�dr�n, the best-selling author of <i>When Things Fall Apart, </i>Ezra Bayda writes with clear, heartfelt simplicity, using his own life stories to illustrate the teachings in an immediate and accessible way that will appeal to a broad spectrum of readers.</p><p>The paradox of Zen is that learning to just live in the present requires lots of hard work. In <i>Being Zen</i>, seasoned Zen teacher Ezra Bayda unpacks this paradox. He demonstrates the need to just be and then instructs us how to undertake the hard work with precision and persistence. Through personal anecdotes he shows us how we keep ourselves from living a genuine life. Instead, we maintain an ideal image of ourselves by creating strategies that depend on delusive self-images, blind spots, and knee-jerk reactions. He then shows how, by "living the practice life," we can relentlessly observe this process and transform our edifices into open spaces of natural awareness and innate compassion. Bayda offers specific practices for dealing with such automatic emotions as anger and fear, teaching how they can be dampened and eventually dissolved. A "how-to" book in the best sense of the word, <i>Being Zen</i> is about how to just live. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Ezra Bayda teaches at Zen Center San Diego. He is also the author of <i>Being Zen, At Home in the Muddy Water, Saying Yes to Life (Even the Hard Parts),</i> and <i>Zen Heart</i>.

Led by the conjurer Laromendis, they are fleeing the relentless demon hordes that are sweeping through their galaxy and destroying the elves' vast empire planet by planet. Only by escaping to Midkemia and brutally overtaking the war-weary world can the last remnants of a mighty civilization hope to survive . . . if the Dread Legion does not pursue them through the rift. </p><p>The magician Pug, Midkemia's brave and constant defender, is all too familiar with the Demon King Maarg and his minions and their foul capacity for savagery and horror, and he recognizes the even graver threat that is following on the heels of the elven invasion. The onslaught to come will dwarf every dire catastrophe his imperiled world has previously withstood, and there is no magical champion in all of Midkemia powerful enough to prevent it. Only one path remains for Pug and Midkemia's clandestine protectors, the Conclave of Shadows: forging an alliance of formidable magical talents, from the demon-dealing warlock Amirantha, brother of Pug's hated foe, and the demon-taming cleric Sandreena, to the elven Queen Miranda, to the warrior Tomas. However, uniting enemies and bitter, vengeful former lovers will be no easy task, and even together they may ultimately be unable to turn the death tide. But a failure to do so will most certainly ensure Midkemia's doom. </p><p><strong>Raymond E.

From the farms, mostly, as far as he could tell. No weaklings. Cuba, the man in the Western suit had told him, needed sturdy workers. Chen Pan was taller than most of the recruits, and his arms were taut with muscles. His hair was tied back in a thick queue, but at twenty years old he barely needed to shave.<br><br>A few families came to see their men off. The women gave their husbands sticky rice balls and packets of seeds for their journey. There was no weeping. Even the smallest children were dry-eyed. Most of the men, like Chen Pan, went aboard alone and empty-handed.<br><br>That evening at sea, the coast of China gradually faded behind them. A haloed moon rose on a swell of wind, but this hopeful omen didn&#x2019;t alter the facts of the ship. It was outfitted like a prison, with irons and grates. The recruits were kept belowdecks, like animals in a pen. The shortest among them couldn&#x2019;t stand upright. Soon Chen Pan&#x2019;s neck ached from stooping.<br><br>Neither the British captain nor his crew spoke much Chinese. The captain issued his orders with a flat expression and a wave of his girlish hands. His crew was far more unruly. They threatened the re- cruits with muskets and cutlasses and rattan rods, shackled those whom the rods didn&#x2019;t tame. Chen Pan was struck with a hoisting rope for requesting an extra blanket.<br><br>Those men who&#x2019;d brought food or tobacco on board began to barter and sell. These boiled chicken feet for your hemp sandals or your uncle&#x2019;s flute. A handful of pumpkin seeds for your stash of turnips or hard-boiled eggs. A day&#x2019;s opium for the woolen gloves. Gambling sprouted like snake-grass in every bunk. The incessant clicking of dice finely divided the hours. A man from W&#x2014;&#x2014; gathered most of the winnings and crowed, &#x201c;If you were too dumb the life before, you won&#x2019;t be enlightened today!&#x201d;<br><br>After his misfortunes in Amoy, Chen Pan refused to gamble. He guarded his Mexican coins, tucking them between the meager cheeks of his buttocks for safekeeping.<br><br>The men got beef jerky and rice gruel to eat. Chen Pan ate, although the taste of the food sickened him. It was oversalted, and the lack of adequate water made him desperately thirsty. Hour after hour, he thought more of his shoe-leather throat than of the life awaiting him in Cuba. Those who demanded more water were answered with blows. Chen Pan watched men drink their own urine, lick moisture from the walls of the ship. A few swallowed seawater until their stomachs swelled and they choked in their own filth.<br><br>A squat melon-grower from T&#x2014;&#x2014; announced that he would throw himself into the ocean to end his torment. Chen Pan crept on deck with two others to watch him jump. The melon-grower didn&#x2019;t shout or linger but simply stepped into the breeze. A moment later, the furling waves received him with indifference. The melon-grower had been an orphan and a bachelor. No destiny would be altered but his.<br><br>The ship continued to plow south into the hard-gusting wind. Chen Pan covered his ears so they wouldn&#x2019;t blow away altogether. He asked himself four questions: What was the last sound the melon-grower heard? The last color he saw before he died? How long would it take for the fish to devour him? Would this death complete his fate? &#x201c;Show me the person who doesn&#x2019;t die,&#x201d; shrugged a short-legged man next to Chen Pan.<br><br>This was something Chen Pan&#x2019;s father used to say, that death alone remained impartial. All the towering men, all the great beauties with kingfisher plumes in their hair&#x2014;not a single one expected to grow old. But they, too, would return to dust. If it was true that man had two souls, one of the body and the other ethereal, then they would merge with the earth and the air after death.<br><br>Chen Pan knew that he didn&#x2019;t want to fade away slowly, like a dying candle&#x2014;one day no different from the next; the dirt etched in his hands along with his fortunes. No, he would rather live in a blaze of courage and flame like Li Kuang, the ferocious warrior who&#x2019;d battled the Huns, or the heroes in the stories his father had recounted to him.<br><br>Chen Pan&#x2019;s father had been as restless as these heroes, never reconciling himself to a life on their farm. He&#x2019;d recited the Songs of Wu as he&#x2019;d absentmindedly hoed the wheat fields, grew devoted to the poetry of the deserted concubines of the Han court. He&#x2019;d referred to the sun as the Lantern Dragon, the Crow in Flight, the White Colt. The moon was the Silver Dish or the Golden Ring.<br><br>Father had taken the Imperial examinations for twenty years without success. He&#x2019;d been a good poet but incapable of composing verses on assigned subjects, as was required by the examiners. He&#x2019;d blamed his absorption of useless knowledge for overburdening his imagination. Before picking up his brush to write, he would rub his inkstick on a whetstone for a meditative hour as Chen Pan watched.<br><br>Chen Pan&#x2019;s mother ridiculed her husband as she hobbled from room to room on her lotus feet. &#x201c;Ha! Everyone calls him a scholar, but he hasn&#x2019;t found a position yet. And in winter he wears a thread- bare robe. This is how books fool us!&#x201d; Chen Pan&#x2019;s mother was from a family of well-to-do farmers, and far from beautiful. She knew little poetry, but used to repeat the same line to nettle her improvident husband: Poets mostly starve to death embracing empty mountains!<br><br>After ten days of cramped, stinking squalor, a fight erupted belowdecks. A city man named Yang Y�n, contrary as a donkey, shoved a quiet farmer out of his bunk. &#x201c;Son of a whore!&#x201d; the farmer shouted, punching Yang Y�n in the chest. The city man pulled a knife from his vest and silvered the air with reckless slashing. The farmer disarmed him in no time, then promptly broke his nose.<br><br>Chen Pan watched the fight from behind his tattered book of poems, a last gift from his father. He decided that if Yang Y�n or any of the other city cocks so much as jostled his elbow, he would knock them unconscious with a blow.<br><br>The captain&#x2019;s guards chained the troublemakers to iron posts. Others who&#x2019;d cheered them on were flogged to intimidate the rest. When the stubborn Lin Chin resisted, the guards kicked him in the ribs until he spat blood. The next day he died and his body was dumped in the sea. It was said that Lin Chin didn&#x2019;t sink at first but floated alongside the ship for hours, his eyes fixed on the sky. Chen Pan wondered if the dead man&#x2019;s ghost would find its way back to China. Or would it wander forever among the unvirtuous and the depraved?<br><br>As the ship continued to sail, Chen Pan imagined his wife pounding the season&#x2019;s meager yield of grain in their yard, looking warily to the sky for rain. They&#x2019;d been married for three years but had no children. Unlucky, despite what the matchmaker had predicted. On their wedding night, Chen Pan and his wife had drunk pomegranate wine and she&#x2019;d grazed his chest with her soft, scant breasts. But month after month her womb spilled its blood.<br><br>Chen Pan&#x2019;s mother blamed his wife for ruining the family with her persistent barrenness. Weak and sallow-skinned, Mother ruled the farm from her bed, knees tucked to her chest, lotus feet curled and useless from the painful binding long ago. In her closet were three minuscule pairs of jeweled slippers, all that remained of a dowry once rich with silks and brocades.<br><br>She also chastised Chen Pan&#x2019;s younger brother for spending his days writing with his one brush and inkpot. &#x201c;Even from the grave, your father has cursed you with his useless ways!&#x201d; In winter, their house grew so cold that his small supply of ink froze.<br><br>On board, the recruits began to suffer every manner of illness. Cholera. Ty- phus. Dysentery. Bad luck, Chen Pan decided, had settled into every crevice of the ship. Nine men died the first month, not counting those killed in fights or beaten to death by the crew. Many more might have perished but for Chien Shih-kuang, sorcerer of herbs and roots. With his felt bag of magic, the wry herbalist from Z&#x2014;&#x2014; brewed teas to mend every imbalance, quieting fiery livers, warming cold organs, restoring the temperamental ch&#x2019;i.<br><br>The captain had promised Chien Shih-kuang payment of passage back to Amoy in return for his services on board. The herbalist had agreed because he&#x2019;d heard that in Cuba men knew the secret to halting the winter retreat of the sun. He, too, wished to learn this secret.<br><br>One night Chen Pan dreamed that bandits had set fire to his great-aunt&#x2019;s farm and that he alone was battling the flames. He woke up delirious, his skin hot and itchy. Chien Shih-kuang plastered a five-pointed leaf on Chen Pan&#x2019;s forehead with a few drops of a caustic liquid. When his fever broke, Chen Pan tried to pay the doctor with one of his precious Mexican coins, but Chien Shih-kuang refused it. (Years later, Chen Pan would learn that the herbalist had married a Spanish heiress in Avila and generously cured the poor.)<br><br>But not even Chien Shih-kuang could save the poor suicides. Chen Pan counted six altogether. Af- ter the melon-grower, another man jumped into the sea. One more poisoned himself with stolen opium. A boy, no older than fifteen, passed his days and nights in tears. He confided to Chen Pan that he was in great grief over having been decoyed on board. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only child of my parents!&#x201d; he cried before thrusting a sharpened chopstick into his ear. In this way he stopped his regretting.<br><br>A native of K&#x2014;&#x2014; hanged himself with strips of torn clothing deep in the ship&#x2019;s hull. (The guards had beaten him savagely for siphoning rainwater from their private barrels.) Chen Pan thought his swaying sounded like the slow tearing of silk. With the winds stiff and the sea wide all around, he asked himself why someone would choose to die so confined and without air. Chen Pan wasn&#x2019;t certain what made a man ultimately want to live. He only knew that he would survive unless somebody managed to kill him.<br><br>The night the Wong brothers died, a squall engulfed the sea. The ship creaked and groaned like a sick man. The storm ripped off a mast and tossed two officers overboard. The men feared that the brothers&#x2019; ghosts had cursed the ship, that they were causing the thunder and lightning, the wind from eight directions, the waves as high as the Buddha&#x2019;s temples. But by morning the sea was calm.<br><br>At noon, a pair of whales was spotted off the Cape of Good Hope. Chen Pan clambered to the deck to see the breaching beasts. &#x201c;Maybe we should kill them and get some fresh meat,&#x201d; the lazy-eyed Wu Yao suggested. Chen Pan looked at him incredulously. It was obvious that this city boy had never caught so much as a pond carp.<br><br>T he rumors spread with every day at sea. A bankrupt tailor pieced most of the gossip together, all the while quoting ancient sayings. Caged birds miss their home forest. Pooled fish long for the deep. Chen Pan listened closely to the tailor, but he didn&#x2019;t circulate the man&#x2019;s tidings: that their ship was headed for the Philippines; that every last man on board would be killed there, heart scooped from his chest; that they&#x2019;d be sold to cannibals who savored yellow flesh.<br><br>There was talk of mutiny. Should they behead the captain and crew? Set fire to the vessel? Reverse their course to China? Chen Pan knew there were men on board fit for murder, experienced warriors who&#x2019;d fought the British barbarians. Arrow-scarred, they&#x2019;d been dragged from their prison cells to the ship. But the ones who talked loudest were most filled with hot air.<br><br>Chen Pan grew increasingly regretful. Had he deceived himself with his own grand dreams? How could he go home poorer than when he&#x2019;d left? (Already, he imagined his mother&#x2019;s rebukes.) He tried to concentrate on his return to China a few years hence. A procession of men would follow him, triumphant in his sedan chair, carrying a hundred chests of princely gifts on their shoulders. Enough silk for three generations. New harnesses for the village horses. Countless jars of turtle eggs pickled in foreign wines. The villagers would gather around him, paying him the respect in life that his father had achieved only in death.<br><br>Because the days were long and the men so constricted, they entertained each other with stories about the tallest men who ever lived. Chung Lu-y�an, who was fond of lantern riddles, reported of a man who, sitting down, was as big as a mountain and could dam the course of a river with his ass. Hsieh Shuang-chi, a stevedore who was tricked on board by his greedy brother-in-law, told of a giant who drank a thousand gallons of celestial dew for his breakfast.<br><br>Chen Pan retold the jokes he&#x2019;d learned from his beloved great-aunt. His favorite was the one about the evil warlord who&#x2019;d had the length of his penis extended with a baby elephant&#x2019;s trunk. Everything went well for the warlord, Chen Pan said, until the day he passed a peanut vendor in the street.<br><br>There was also a dwarf on board who could imitate perfectly the sounds of a cassia-wood harp. His name was Yang Shi-f�ng, and he sang of his land, where the tallest men grew to no more than three feet. In former times, he said, his countrymen had been sent as jesters and slaves to the Imperial Court. Then Yang Cheng came to govern the land of the dwarves and convinced the Emperor to annul his cruel trade. To this day every male born in T&#x2014;&#x2014; has Yang in his name.<br><br>Others recounted the tale of the impudent Monkey King. Entrusted with the job of guarding the Im- mortals&#x2019; heavenly peaches, the Monkey King heartily partook of them instead. One transgression followed another, but none of the Jade Emperor&#x2019;s emissaries could catch the fearless simian. Finally, the Buddha himself cast a powerful spell that sealed the monkey under a mountain for five hundred years.<br><br>On a nearby bunk, a pig breeder from N&#x2014;&#x2014; reminded Chen Pan of his father. His hair fluttered with unruly tufts, no matter that the air was perfectly still. The pig breeder shared the last of his wife&#x2019;s pickled cabbage with Chen Pan. The taste made them both terribly homesick. Chen Pan recalled the long summer afternoons his father had read poems to him, their plows left untouched in the shed. Before long the cicadas would sing, signaling the onset of autumn.<br><br>These lovely seasons and fragrant years falling<br><br>Lonely away&#x2014;we share such emptiness here<br><br>When Chen Pan was thirteen, bandits had murdered his father for protesting the rape of the water-carrier&#x2019;s daughter. She was only ten, pretty and dull, and willingly had shown the bandits inside her neighbor&#x2019;s granary. Father&#x2019;s legend swelled and the villagers recounted his heroism, but Mother disputed their accolades. &#x201c;What father leaves his children noth- ing but his good reputation to eat?&#x201d; She scolded her sons to learn this lesson: &#x201c;Avert your eyes to the sorrows of others and keep your own plates full!&#x201d;<br><br>After three months at sea, Chen Pan&#x2019;s arms and legs grew soft and white as the flesh of the rich women he&#x2019;d glimpsed in Amoy. Often he fantasized about these women, inhaled the scent of their lacquered hair, slowly dared to love them. He recalled the tales of the women of the old Imperial Court, who were protected by the Emperor&#x2019;s purple-robed eunuchs. Alluring women swathed in furs and jade, their gauze-silk sleeves blooming like orchids. Delicate women who drank only camel-pad broth and nibbled on rare winter fruit to maintain their complexions. Women best admired from afar, like the mountain mist.<br><br>Sometimes the men spoke wistfully of the road- side flowers who awaited them in Cuba, easy amber- colored whores who opened their legs for their own pleasure, expecting nothing in return. For all that it had cost him, Chen Pan couldn&#x2019;t remember his one night with the dancing girl in Amoy. There were only the memories of his...</p><h2>The Ideal Bride (Cynster Novels, 11)</h2><p><p></p><blockquote><em>New York Times </em>bestselling author Stephanie Laurens has created some of romance's most unforgettable novels.

But her wits and (frequently) sharp tongue are hers alone. </p><p>Now, working as a private informer in Rome during the reign of Domitian, Flavia has taken over her father's old ramshackle digs at Fountain Court in the Surbura district, where she plies her trade with energy, determination, and the usual Falco luck. Recently hired to help investigate a fatal accident, she finds herself stuck with a truly awful person for a client and facing a well-heeled, well-connected opponent. </p><p>That is, until her client unexpectedly dies under what might be called "suspicious circumstances." While this is not a huge loss for society, it is a loss for Flavia Albia's pocket. Even worse, it's just one of a series of similar deaths for which she now finds herself under suspicion. Before things go from abysmal to worse, Flavia must sort out what is happening, and who is responsible, in Lindsey Davis' <i>The Ides of April.</i></p></p><p>LINDSEY DAVIS is the author of <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling series of historical mysteries featuring Marcus Didius Falco. She lives in London.I <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Lucius Bassus was three years old when his mother took her eyes off him and he ran out of the house to play. They lived on the Clivus Publicius, a steep road on the Aventine Hill, where he was knocked down by a builder&#x2019;s cart. The cart, which escaped its driver&#x2019;s control as it sped down the slope, was owned by Metellus and Nepos, an outfit that worked from a yard on the hill. Nobody talked about Nepos; at first I thought he might be an invention for some tax fiddle. <br>This business was no more shady than most in Imperial Rome. It carried out refurbishments for bar owners who wanted to move up from blatantly sleazy to a pretence of hygiene. The custom was that the Metellus crew would tender for a full deep-clean and fancy renovation, promising to complete in eight weeks max. In practice, every project took two years and they skimped on the fittings. They would re-grout the marble counters, put in a new doorstep, provide a misspelt signboard and charge the earth for it. By then their clients, unable to operate in the permanent dustcloud, had lost their custom and were going under. It amazed me that other bar owners saw what happened yet still used the firm, but they did. Over the years Metellus and Nepos had done very nicely out of Roman rotgut-sellers innocently trusting them. But killing a child, in the close-knit Aventine community where we had <i>some</i> standards, just might be commercially stupid. <br>Lucius died at once from his injuries. He never stood a chance. He expired on the kerb. Inevitably, at that very moment his distraught mother came out of the house. It helped fuel local outrage. <br>The ramshackle cart had been overloaded. The draught oxen were both past their best. Their driver was blind drunk, no question. He denied that on principle, the principle being that Salvidia, the vinegary widow who had inherited the shopfitting business from the husband she had driven to his grave, would not pay his wages if he told the truth. There were witnesses, a large group of whom gathered in the Clivus and took an interest, but they all disappeared when a busybody produced a note tablet and started collecting names. <br>Once the funeral with its pathetic tiny coffin had been held, well-meaning neighbours started to suggest that the family were entitled to payment for their terrible loss. Everyone agreed they should immediately hire an informer to look into the legal aspects. If being hit on the head by a falling flower tub could be worth cash to the victim, what price a child&#x2019;s life under civil law? Someone (it was rumoured to be the note tablet busybody I mentioned) even wrote up on a wall a plea for concerned citizens who had been present at the accident to come forward. It must have appeared before the first of April, because I saw it that day, the Kalends. The poster sounded official. While not actually offering payment, it implied possible advantage. As a professional, I read it with interest. I found it subtly done. <br>By then, I had become involved. Any investigator who was favoured by Fortune would be taken on by the heartbroken mother to negotiate compensation. This was a public-spirited task, where a reputable person could maintain a clear conscience: you look into the facts, you put those facts to the guilty party succinctly, you say, &#x201c;I am a top informer, this is meat and drink to me; a toddler is dead and a jury will be weeping into their togas, but nobody wants this to go to court, do we?&#x201d; The guilty cough up, and you cream off your percentage. <br>Not me. Fortune never favoured me and the problem with being a woman was that sometimes I could only obtain business that all the male informers had sniffed and refused. This was one of those months. <i>I</i> was hired by Salvidia. The owner of Metellus and Nepos wanted me to help her beat off the mother&#x2019;s claim. Typical. <br>From what I have already said about this construction group, you will guess my employment was on a &#x201c;no win, no fee&#x201d; basis. Indeed, I was starting to feel its basis might amount to &#x201c;win, but even then the bastards never pay up&#x201d;&#x2014;like so much of my work, unfortunately. After a week, I was ready to abandon the miserable project, but I had already put in quite a few hours and, besides, I never like to be defeated. The poster asking for witnesses suggested someone else felt the same way. <br>The wall graffiti included an address where people could make statements, so as my enquiries were stuck, I went along to see if any had done so. My line would be that as I was assisting a party in the dispute, I had the right to ask. As a female I had no rights at all in matters of law, but why let that stop me? Either way, I was hoping to plea-bargain. Anything to have this finished fast, so I could drop the case. <br>The address was the Temple of Ceres. It was close to my home and office, though on a far grander street than the blind alley I lived in. Anywhere would be finer than that. Fountain Court holds no attractions for the founders of fine religious buildings. <br>Arranging assignations at temples is common in Rome. For strangers it is neutral ground. For instance, married men find the steps of temples convenient for picking up prostitutes. The grander the temple, the lousier its hangers-on. Inured to the seamy side of our city, the public pass by without noticing. Suggesting a meet at a temple was, I presumed, simply for convenience. Thinking little of it, I went along on spec. <br>Only when I asked for the contact on the wall notice did I learn he was a big prawn in a purple-edged toga who belonged to an ancient order of magistrates. The Temple of Ceres was their headquarters and archive depository. <br>I reconsidered. Then I went home and made alterations to my appearance. I was visiting the office of men of great consequence in Rome: men of wealth and power. I did not suppose &#x201c;Manlius Faustus&#x201d; had chalked up graffiti on the Clivus Publicius in person, but some minion certainly did it in his name. That minion must have felt confident Faustus would enjoy throwing his weight about. By definition this magistrate was one of those menaces who drive traders wild checking market weights. I had been trained by my father to avoid such types, though in fact those over-promoted snoots don&#x2019;t tangle with me. I have contacts, but no one that important. <br>Still, it always pays to respect the opposition. So I changed into a full-length tunic in a neutral shade, not white, not quite unbleached linen, but neat, tidy and unthreatening. It did have an embroidered neckline that suggested money, which in turn hints at a woman with influential men behind her, one who should not be too quickly or too rudely dismissed. <br>My earrings were plain gold rosettes. I added a row of bangles, to give me confidence. Hair pinned up. Three dabs of a discreet perfume. A large stole: the demure, respectable widow look. I really am a widow, so that part was right. <br>Mother had taught me how to pose as a meek matron. It was ridiculous and hypocritical, but the act now came as second nature and I could manage it without laughing. <br>So, feeling convinced that I was as good as them and could handle these bastards, I set off for my first encounter with the plebeian aediles. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Lindsey Davis <br></p><h2>Flashman on the March (Flashman Papers)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s 1868 and Sir Harry Flashman, V.C., arch-cad, amorist, cold-headed soldier, and reluctant hero, is back! Fleeing a chain of vengeful pursuers that includes Mexican bandits, the French Foreign Legion, and the relatives of an infatuated Austrian beauty, Flashy is desperate for somewhere to take cover. So desperate, in fact, that he embarks on a perilous secret intelligence-gathering mission to help free a group of Britons being held captive by a tyrannical Abyssinian king. Along the way, of course, are nightmare castles, brigands, massacres, rebellions, orgies, and the loveliest and most lethal women in Africa, all of which will test the limits of the great bounder&#x2019;s talents for knavery, amorous intrigue, and survival.<br><br><i>Flashman on the March&#x2014;</i>the twelfth book in George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s ever-beloved, always scandalous Flashman Papers series--is Flashman and Fraser at their best.</p><p>George MacDonald Fraser was born in England and educated in Scotland.

Worth a hundred thou&#x2019; in quids.&#x201d; He held up a gleaming coin, broad as a crown, with the old girl double-chinned on one side and the Austrian arms on t&#x2019;other. &#x201c;Dam&#x2019; disinheritin&#x2019; old bitch, what? Mind, they say she was a plum in her youth, blonde and buxom, just your sort, Flashy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ne&#x2019;er mind my sort. The cash must reach this place in Africa within four weeks? And the chap who was to have escorted it is laid up in Venice with yellow jack?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Or the clap, or the sailor&#x2019;s itch, or heaven knows what.&#x201d; He spun the coin, grinning foxy-like. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve changed your mind, haven&#x2019;t you? You&#x2019;re game to do it yourself! Good old Flash!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t rush your fences, Speed, my boy. When&#x2019;s it due to be shipped out?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wednesday. Lloyd packet to Alexandria. But with Sturgess comin&#x2019; all over yellow in Venice, that won&#x2019;t do, and there ain&#x2019;t another Alex boat for a fortnight&#x2014;far too late, and the Embassy&#x2019;ll run my guts up the flagpole, as though &#x2019;twas my fault, confound &#x2019;em&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Aye, it&#x2019;s hell in the diplomatic. Well, tell you what, Speed&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll ride guard on your dollars to Alex for you, but I ain&#x2019;t waiting till Wednesday. I want to be clear of this blasted town by dawn tomorrow, so you&#x2019;d best drum up a steam-launch and crew, and get your precious treasure aboard tonight&#x2014;where is it just now?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;At the station, the Strada Ferrata&#x2014;but dammit, Flash, a private charter&#x2019;ll cost the moon&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got Embassy dibs, haven&#x2019;t you? Then use &#x2019;em! The station ain&#x2019;t spitting distance from the Klutsch mole, and if you get a move on you can have the gelt loaded by midnight. Heavens, man, steam craft and spaghetti sailors are ten a penny in Trieste! If you&#x2019;re in such a sweat to get the dollars to Africa&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You may believe it! Let me see . . . quick run to Alex, then train to Cairo and on to Suez&#x2014;no camel caravans across the desert these days, but you&#x2019;ll need to hire nigger porters&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For which you&#x2019;ll furnish me cash!&#x201d;<br><br> He waved a hand. &#x201c;Sturgess would&#x2019;ve had to hire &#x2019;em, anyway. At Suez one of our Navy sloops&#x2019;ll take you down the Red Sea&#x2014;there are shoals of &#x2019;em, chasin&#x2019; the slavers, and I&#x2019;ll give you an Embassy order. They&#x2019;ll have you at Zoola&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the port for Abyssinia&#x2014;by the middle of February, and it can&#x2019;t take above a week to get the silver up-country to this place called Attegrat. That&#x2019;s where General Napier will be.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Napier? Not Bob the Bughunter? What the blazes is he doing in Abyssinia? We haven&#x2019;t got a station there.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We have by now, you may be sure!&#x201d; He was laughing in disbelief. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you mean to tell me you haven&#x2019;t heard? Why, he&#x2019;s invadin&#x2019; the place! With an army from India! The silver is to help fund his campaign, don&#x2019;t you see? Good God, Flashy, where have you been? Oh, I was forgettin&#x2019;&#x2014;Mexico. Dash it, don&#x2019;t they have newspapers there?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hold up, can&#x2019;t you? Why is he invading?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To rescue the captives&#x2014;our consul, envoys, missionaries! They&#x2019;re held prisoner by this mad cannibal king, and he&#x2019;s chainin&#x2019; &#x2019;em, and floggin&#x2019; &#x2019;em, and kickin&#x2019; up no end of a row! Theodore, his name is&#x2014;and you mean to say you&#x2019;ve not heard of him? I&#x2019;ll be damned&#x2014;why, there&#x2019;s been uproar in Parliament, our gracious Queen writin&#x2019; letters, a penny or more on the income tax&#x2014;it&#x2019;s true! Now d&#x2019;you see why this silver must reach Napier double quick&#x2014;if it don&#x2019;t, he&#x2019;ll be adrift in the middle of nowhere with not a penny to his name, and your old chum Speedicut will be a human sacrifice at the openin&#x2019; of the new Foreign Office!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But why should Napier need Austrian silver? Hasn&#x2019;t he got any sterling?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Abyssinian niggers won&#x2019;t touch it, or anythin&#x2019; except Maria Theresas. Purest silver, you see, and Napier must have it for food and forage when he marches up-country to fight his war.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s a war-chest? You never said a dam&#x2019; word about war last night.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You never gave me a chance, did you? Soon as I told you I was in Dickie&#x2019;s meadow, with this damned fortune to be shipped and Sturgess in dock, what sympathy did dear old friend Flashy offer? The horse&#x2019;s laugh, and wished me joy! All for England, home, and the beauteous Elspeth, you were . . . and now,&#x201d; says he, with that old leery Speedicut look, &#x201c;all of a sudden, you&#x2019;re in the dooce of a hurry to oblige . . . What&#x2019;s up, Flash?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not a dam&#x2019; thing. I&#x2019;m sick of Trieste and want away, that&#x2019;s all!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And can&#x2019;t wait a day? You and Hookey Walker!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Now, see here, Speed, d&#x2019;ye want me to shift your blasted bullion, or don&#x2019;t you? Well, I go tonight or not at all, and since this cash is so all-fired important to Napier, your Embassy funds can stand the row for my passage home, too, when the thing&#x2019;s done! Well, what d&#x2019;ye say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That something is up, no error!&#x201d; His eyes widened. &#x201c;I say, the Austrian traps ain&#x2019;t after you, are they&#x2014;&#x2019;cos if they were I daren&#x2019;t assist your flight, silver or no silver! Dash it, I&#x2019;m a diplomat&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course &#x2019;tain&#x2019;t the traps! What sort of fellow d&#x2019;ye think I am? Good God, ha&#x2019;nt we been chums since boyhood?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, and it&#x2019;s &#x2019;cos I know what kind of chum you can be that I repeat &#x2018;What&#x2019;s up, Flash?&#x2019; &#x201d; He filled my glass and pushed it across. &#x201c;Come up, old boy! This is old Speed, remember, and you can&#x2019;t humbug him.&#x201d;<br><br> Well, true enough, I couldn&#x2019;t, and since you, dear reader, may be sharing his curiosity, I&#x2019;ll tell you what I told him that night in the H�tel Victoria&#x2014;not the smartest pub in Trieste, but as a patriotic little minion of our Vienna Embassy, Speedicut was bound to put up there&#x2014;and it should explain the somewhat cryptic exchanges with which I&#x2019;ve begun this chapter of my memoirs. If they&#x2019;ve seemed a mite bewildering you&#x2019;ll see presently that they were the simplest way of setting out the preliminaries to my tale of the strangest campaign in the whole history of British arms&#x2014;and that takes in some damned odd affairs, a few of which I&#x2019;ve borne a reluctant hand in myself. But Abyssinia took the cake, currants and all. Never anything like it, and never will be again.<br><br> For me, the business began in the summer of &#x2019;67, on the day when that almighty idiot, the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, strode out before a Juarista firing squad, unbuttoned his shirt cool as a trout, and cried &#x201c;Viva M�jico! Viva la independencia! Shoot, soldiers, through the heart!&#x201d; Which they did, with surprising accuracy for a platoon of dagoes, thereby depriving Mexico of its crowned head and Flashy of his employer and protector. I was an anxious spectator skulking in cover on a rooftop nearby, and when I saw Max take a header into the dust I knew that the time had come for me to slip my cable.<br><br> You see, I&#x2019;d been his fairly loyal aide-de-camp in his recent futile struggle against Juarez&#x2019;s republicans&#x2014;not a post I&#x2019;d taken from choice, but I&#x2019;d been a deserter from the French Foreign Legion at the time. They were polluting Mexico with their presence in those days, supporting Max on behalf of his sponsor, that ghastly louse Louis Napoleon, and I&#x2019;d been only too glad of the refuge Max had offered me&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been under the mistaken impression that I&#x2019;d saved his life in an ambush at Texatl, poor ass, when in fact I&#x2019;d been one of Jes�s Montero&#x2019;s gang of ambushers, but we needn&#x2019;t go into that at the moment. What mattered was that Max had taken me on the strength, and had given the Legion peelers the right about when they&#x2019;d come clamouring for my unhappy carcase.<br><br> Then the Frogs cleared out in March of &#x2019;67, leaving Max in the lurch with typical Gallic loyalty, but while that removed one menace to my well-being, there remained others from which Max could be no protection, quick or dead&#x2014;like the Juaristas, who&#x2019;d rather have strung up a royalist a.d.c. than eaten their dinners, or that persevering old bandolero Jes�s Montero, who was bound to find out eventually that I didn&#x2019;t know where Montezuma&#x2019;s treasure was. Hell of a place, Mexico, and dam&#x2019; confused.<br><br> But all you need to know for the present is that after Max bought the bullet I&#x2019;d have joined him in the dead-cart if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the delectable Princess Agnes Salm-Salm, and the still happily ignorant Jes�s. They&#x2019;d been my associates in a botched attempt to rescue Max on the eve of his execution. We&#x2019;d failed because (you&#x2019;ll hardly credit this) the great clown had refused point-blank to escape because it didn&#x2019;t sort with his imperial dignity, Austro-Hungarian royalty preferring to die rather than go over the wall. Well, hell mend &#x2019;em, I say, and if the House of Hapsburg goes to the knackers it won&#x2019;t be my fault; I&#x2019;ve done my unwilling best for them, ungrateful bastards.<br><br> At all events, darling Aggie and greasy Jesus had seen me safe to Vera Cruz, where she had devised the most capital scheme for getting me out of the country. Max having been brother to the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef, his death had caused a sensation in Vienna; they hadn&#x2019;t done a dam&#x2019; thing useful to save his life, but they made up for it with his corpse, sending a warship to ferry it home, with a real live admiral and a great retinue of court reptiles. And since Aggie was the wife of a German princeling, a heroine of the royalist campaign, and handsome as Hebe, they were all over her when we went aboard the Novara frigate at Sacraficios. Admiral Tegethoff, a bluff old sport, all beard and belly, munched her knuckles and gave glad welcome even to the begrimed and ragged peon whom she presented as the hoch und wohlgeboren Oberst Sir Harry Flashman, former aide, champion, and all-round hero of the campaign and the ill-starred attempt to snatch his imperial majesty from the firing squad.<br><br> &#x201c;The Emperor&#x2019;s English right arm, gentlemen!&#x201d; says Aggie, who was a great hand at the flashing-eyed flourish. &#x201c;So his majesty called him. Who more fitting to guard his royal master and friend on his last journey home?&#x201d;<br><br> Blessed if they could think of anyone fitter, and I was received with polite enthusiasm: the reptiles left off sneering at my beastly peasant appearance and clicked their heels, old Tegethoff stopped just short of embracing me, and I was aware of the awestruck admiration in the wide blue eyes of the enchanting blonde poppet whom he presented as his great-niece, Gertrude von und zum something-or-other. My worldly Aggie noticed it too, and observed afterwards, when we made our adieus at the ship&#x2019;s rail, that if I looked like a scarecrow I was at least a most romantic one.<br><br> &#x201c;The poor little idiot will doubtless break her foolish heart over you en voyage,&#x201d; says she. &#x201c;And afterwards wonder what she saw in the so dashing English rascal.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jealous of her, princess?&#x201d; says I, and she burst out laughing.<br><br> &#x201c;Of her youth, perhaps&#x2014;not of her infatuation.&#x201d; She gave that slantendicular smile that had been driving me wild for months. &#x201c;Well, not very much. But if I were sixteen again, like her, who knows? Adi�s, dear Harry.&#x201d; And being royally careless of propriety, she kissed me full on the lips before the startled squareheads&#x2014;and for a delightful moment it was the kiss of the lover she&#x2019;d never been, which I still count a real conquest. Pity she was so crazy about her husband, I remember thinking, as she waved an elegant hand from her carriage and was gone.<br><br> After that they towed Max&#x2019;s coffin out to the ship in a barge and hoisted it inboard, and as the newly appointed escort to his cadaver I was bound to give Tegethoff and his entourage a squint at the deceased, so that they could be sure they&#x2019;d got the right chap. It was no end of a business, for his Mexican courtiers had done him proud with no fewer than three coffins, one of rosewood, a second of zinc, and the third of cedar, with Max inside the last like one of those Russian dolls. He&#x2019;d been embalmed, and I must say he looked in capital fettle, bar being a touch yellow and his hair starting to fall out. We screwed him in again, a chaplain said a prayer, and all that remained was to weigh anchor to thunderous salutes from various attendant warships, and for me to remind Tegethoff that a bath and a change of clobber would be in order.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve never had any great love for the cabbage-chewers, having been given my bellyful by Bismarck and his gang in the Schleswig-Holstein affair,* and Tegethoff&#x2019;s party included more than one of the crop-headed schlager-swingers whom I find especially detestable, but I&#x2019;m bound to say that on that voyage, which lasted from late November &#x2019;67 to the middle of January, they couldn&#x2019;t have been more amiable and hospitable&#x2014;until the very morning we dropped anchor off Trieste, when Tegethoff discovered that I&#x2019;d been giving his great-niece a few exercises they don&#x2019;t usually teach in young ladies&#x2019; seminaries.<br><br> Aggie had been right, you see: the silly chit had gone nutty on me at first sight, and who&#x2019;s to blame her? Stalwart Flashy all bronzed and war-weary in sombrero and whiskers might well flutter a maiden heart, and if at forty-five I was old enough to be her father, that never stopped an adoring innocent yet, and you may be sure it don&#x2019;t stop me either. Puppy-fat and golden sausage curls ain&#x2019;t my style as a rule, but combined with a creamy complexion, parted rosebud lips, and great forget-me-not eyes alight with idiotic worship, they have their attraction. For one thing they awoke blissful memories of Elspeth on that balmy evening when I first rattled her in the bushes by the Clyde. The resemblance was<br><br> * See Royal Flash. more than physical, for both were brainless, although my darling half-wit is not without a certain native cunning, but what made dear little Fr�ulein Gertrude specially irresistible was her truly unfathomable ignorance of the more interesting facts of life, and her touching faith in me as a guide and mentor.<br><br> Her attachment to me on the voyage was treated as something of a joke by Tegethoff&#x2019;s people, who seemed to regard her as a child still, more fool they, and since her duenna was usually too sea-sick to interfere, we were together a good deal. She was the most artless prattler, and was soon confiding her girlish secrets, dreams, and fears; I learned that her doting great-uncle had brought her on the cruise as a betrothal present, and that on her return to Vienna she was to be married to a most aristocratic swell, a graf no less, whom she had never seen and who was on the brink of the grave, being all of thirty years old.<br><br> &#x201c;It is such an honour,&#x201d; sighs she, &#x201c;and my duty, Mama says, but how am I to be worthy of it? I know nothing of how to be a wife, much less a great lady. I am too young, and foolish, and . . . and little! He is a great man, a cousin to the Emperor, and I am only a lesser person!

He spent the next 12 harrowing years of his life as a slave on a Louisiana cotton plantation. During this time he was frequently abused and often afraid for his life. After regaining his freedom in 1853, Northup decided to publish this gripping autobiographical account of his captivity.<br>As an educated man, Northup was able to present an exceptionally detailed and accurate description of slave life and plantation society. Indeed, this book is probably the fullest, most realistic picture of the "peculiar institution" during the three decades before the Civil War. Moreover, Northup tells his story both from the viewpoint of an outsider, who had experienced 30 years of freedom and dignity in the United States before his capture, and as a slave, reduced to total bondage and submission. Very few personal accounts of American slavery were written by slaves with a similar history.<br>Published in 1853, Northup's book found a ready audience and almost immediately became a bestseller. Aside from its vivid depiction of the detention, transportation, and sale of slaves, <i>Twelve Years a Slave</i> is admired for its classic accounts of cotton and sugar production, its uncannily precise recall of people, times, and places, and the compelling details that re-create the daily routine of slaves in the Gulf South. 7 illustrations. Index.</p><p>�</p></p><p>Solomon Northup was a free-born African American from New York, the son of a freed slave. A farmer and violinist, he owned a property in Hebron. In 1841 he was kidnapped by slave-traders, having been enticed with a job offer as a violinist. When he accompanied his supposed employers to Washington, DC, they drugged him and sold him as a slave. He was shipped to New Orleans where he was sold to a plantation owner in Louisiana. He was held in the Red River region of Louisiana by several different owners for 12 years, during which time his friends and family had no word of him. He made repeated attempts to escape and get messages out of the plantation. Eventually he got news to his family, who contacted friends and enlisted the Governor of New York, Washington Hunt, to his cause. He regained his freedom in January 1853 and returned to his family in New York.<p>Introduction</p> <p><i>Twelve Years a Slave, </i>a chronicle of the amazing ordeal of a free African-American kidnapped from Washington, D.C., and impressed into slavery in Louisiana, is one of the most compelling and detailed slave narratives in existence. Although a best-selling book in its time, Solomon Northup&#x2019;s narrative has existed in the shadow of more academically prominent and popularly celebrated narratives like <i>The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass </i>(1845)<i>. </i>Nonetheless, Northup&#x2019;s account of his kidnapping and enslavement is a masterpiece of historical detail, and the narrative has been noted for its easily researched and widely corroborated elements. The text and story were virtually unchallenged by Southern apologists or partisans of the era. Northup resists the urge to laud himself as an exemplary character or focus solely his own experience, giving contemporary readers a remarkable account of the lives of the slave community as a whole. As an educated man, torn from freedom and plunged into slavery, he brings into horrible and tantalizingly exact clarity the life and labor of slaves in the antebellum American South, the complex economic choices and ironic moral concessions of slaveholding, and the calamitous effect of slavery on the foundations of civilization.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Born in 1808 to an unnamed mother and Mintus Northup, a former slave who was freed on the death of his master, Solomon Northup lived the life of a free man and educated tradesman in New York. Beginning with his childhood, he was early acquainted with voting and civic life through his father, and he developed a strong sense of his own liberty and dignity. Like his father, he maintained a cordial relationship with the white family that had previously held his own family in bondage, an association that would help secure his freedom. Northup and his wife, Anne Hampton Northup, were engaged in a quintessentially American quest for social and economic advancement when he was enticed away from the safety of Saratoga Springs, New York, with the promise of work and kidnapped into slavery in 1841. Upon his escape in 1853, Northup resolved to tell his story, first to the <i>New York Times </i>and later in a book through his editor, David Wilson. Although his sensational story showed great commercial promise, Northup insisted in its first pages that his primary aim was to �give a candid and truthful statement of facts:&nbsp; to repeat the story of my life, without exaggeration, leaving it for others to determine, whether even the pages of fiction present a picture of more cruel wrong or a severer bondage.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>Northup&#x2019;s life before slavery was notable because of his industriousness. He worked on the repairs of the Champlain Canal, navigated rafts of supplies from Lake Champlain to Troy, New York, engaged in woodcutting, purchased property, farmed for profit, and worked in railroad construction. In addition, he plied his trade as a violinist during the tourist season. It was in pursuit of work that Northup found himself drugged, kidnapped, and enslaved, and for twelve years he labored in the grinding agricultural netherworld of Southern bondage. After returning to his family, Northup not only published his narrative but also pressed his legal case against his abductors. With the help of Thaddeus St. John, a New York county judge who had witnessed Northup traveling in the company of his abductors, and Henry B. Northup, of the family who had formerly enslaved the African-American Northups, Solomon Northup was able to seek redress in the courts.&nbsp; His abductors, Alexander Merrill and Joseph Russell, were captured and faced trial in 1854. By 1856, the case had meandered through the New York legal system to the state supreme court and the court of appeals, only to be remanded for action in the lower courts.&nbsp; Ultimately, the delays and technicalities of trial exhausted the interest of the state, which did not retry the abductors.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For all of his misfortune and his resulting celebrity, Solomon Northup&#x2019;s end remains a mystery. He returned to his family, who settled in Glen Falls, New York, purchased property, and lived in the area until his death. His wife and family sold their property and moved from the town. The circumstances and date of his death are unknown, but the city of Saratoga Springs still commemorates his life and narrative with an annual �Solomon Northup Day.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Commentary on Northup&#x2019;s penchant for detail punctuates any evaluation of his narrative, and well it should.&nbsp; His descriptions of nineteenth-century cotton production and sugar manufacturing are amazingly detailed historical gifts to scholars of the antebellum era, and they provide revealing texture to the brutal and onerous labor involved on Southern plantations. Given recent questions about the veracity of portions of Olaudah (Olaudiah) Equiano&#x2019;s famous narrative, Northup&#x2019;s exactness and well-supported facts about people and places in his narrative have new contemporary importance. Northup also notes variations in the personalities, characters, attributes, and fortunes of the slaves and slaveholders and even finds space for irony and faint humor amid the considerable pain of slave life. Northup also possesses an egalitarian gaze, and where other escaped slaves have been faulted for selective or manipulative recollection in their narratives, Northup is circumspect.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>While scholars have faulted Frederick Douglass for his one-dimensional and largely physical representations of women (in near-nakedness and under torture or sexual abuse) and the primacy of his own struggle, Northup labors over the details of life in the slave community and gives personality and depth to the varied men and women who were enslaved and abused.&nbsp; He recounts the deceptive appearance of ease and satisfaction Southern slaves and slaveholders presented when traveling North, but he reveals both their true yearnings for liberty and his own early exhortations to them to escape. He also follows the life of the slave Eliza from her treacherous sale, to the loss of her children, to her end as a mere shadow of her once lively and elegant womanhood.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Remarkably, Northup relates what is likely a new version of the story of American slavery for even contemporary readers�a world of plantation life where the backbreaking work is done exclusively by African-American women. Northup writes compellingly of the labor of slave women who are not only caretakers and cooks and cotton hands but also horse-riders and lumberjacks. He describes the exceptional physical strength of Patsey with a remarkably liberated eye, marking no impediment of gender and describing her intellect and acquisition of horsemanship and teamster-talent with ease. At the same time, he takes pains to describe her additional burden as a woman who is the object and victim of her master&#x2019;s lascivious designs and her mistress&#x2019; infernal jealousy.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Northup&#x2019;s narrative is no less an account of the physical horror beyond the bloodstained gate of Southern slavery than others in the genre. The shrieks of pain so familiar to readers of slave narratives are in the air of Northup&#x2019;s plantations, resonating for miles, as they do in so many narrative accounts. But his report of the physical abuse native to slavery is raised to superlative form by his analysis of the psychological, sexual, economic, and personally capricious horrors that accompanied the crack and pain of the lash.&nbsp; Northup distinguishes the lash itself as not just the tool of forcing labor or of venting vicious anger, but also the tool of caprice or a recreational device for slaveholders&#x2019; drunken gamesmanship.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Few, if any, slave narratives relate uplifting and celebratory stories of slaveholders and overseers, but central to <i>Twelve Years a Slave </i>is a careful and nuanced analysis of the slaveholders of the South, Louisiana in particular, that could stand alone as a significant text. The slave civilization Northup describes is a crumbling ruin of the Western world, its rulers fallen creatures largely bereft of virtue. Yet, Northup is evenhanded and scrupulous in his attempt to relate slaveholding culture. He records the ironies and complexities of slaveholding, the notable qualities of those preserved by Christian faith in a modicum of civilization, like William Ford, and the acts of those who are uncommon angels, like Mary McCoy. Little of Southern gentility or the region&#x2019;s historic pretension to being the inheritor of the classical republics exists in Northup&#x2019;s narrative. The slaveholders of Northup&#x2019;s South are largely distinguished by their coarseness and ignorance. Northup sees the plight of slaves and the fault of slaveholders through educated eyes, and he presents the world of antebellum Louisiana with the judicious equanimity of a man of virtues (although not untouched by th...</p></p><h2>Nothing If Not Critical: Selected Essays on Art and Artists</h2><p>The most controversial art critic in America--author of the bestselling The Fatal Shore and The Shock of the New--looks with love and loathing, wit and authority, at art and artists from the past to the present.

In imagination I have sat down beside Timothy and have tried myself to hear and heed this final charge from the aging apostle . . . &#34;On each occasion I have been impressed afresh by the timeliness of today of what the apostle writes, especially for young Christian leaders. For our era is one of theological and moral confusion, even of apostasy. And the apostle summons us, as he summoned Timothy, to be strong, brave and steadfast.&#34;</p><p>John R. W. Stott (1921-2011) has been known worldwide as a preacher, evangelist and communicator of Scripture. For many years he served as rector of All Souls Church in London, where he carried out an effective urban pastoral ministry. A leader among evangelicals in Britain, the United States and around the world, Stott was a principal framer of the landmark Lausanne Covenant (1974). His many books have sold millions of copies around the world and in dozens of languages. Stott's best-known work, <em>Basic Christianity,</em> has sold two million copies and has been translated into more than 60 languages. Other titles include <em>The Cross of Christ, Understanding the Bible, The Contemporary Christian, Evangelical Truth, Issues Facing Christians Today, The Incomparable Christ, Why I Am a Christian</em> and <em>Through the Bible Through the Year,</em> a daily devotional. He has also written eight volumes in <em>The Bible Speaks Today</em> series of New Testament expositions. Whether in the West or in the Two-Thirds World, a hallmark of Stott's ministry has been expository preaching that addresses the hearts and minds of contemporary men and women. Stott was honored by <em>Time</em> magazine in 2005 as one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World" and was named in the Queen?s New Years Honours list as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1969, Stott founded the Langham Trust to fund scholarships for young evangelical leaders from the Majority World. He then founded the Evangelical Literature Trust, which provided books for students, pastors and theological libraries in the Majority World. These two trusts continued as independent charities until 2001, when they were joined as a single charity: the Langham Partnership. Langham's vision continues today to see churches in the Majority World equipped for mission and growing to maturity in Christ through nurturing national movements for biblical preaching, fostering the creation and distribution of evangelical literature, and enhancing evangelical theological education.</p><h2>Lizzie&#39;s Carefree Years: The Buggy Spoke Series, Book 3</h2><p><b>Bestselling Amish novelist Linda Byler&#x2019;s third book in the Buggy Spoke series for young readers</b><br><br>Lizzie is nine years old now and adjusting her new home in Jefferson County.

He was listed in the Blue Book but joined no clubs. His magnificent dining room at Kragsyde, his house at Lobster Cove, rarely entertained visitors. If George Nixon Black was mentioned at all, it was almost as rumor. His greenhouses boasted rare plants, his collection of antiques and paintings were extraordinary and his patronage of the arts favored unknown female artists. Each winter he quietly boarded a luxury European-bound steamship with a man eighteen years his junior. Despite a privileged youth marred by violence and uncertainty, contrasted with the danger his lifestyle and secrets placed him in, his ability to obtain happiness and be himself was remarkable. <br><br> While Black was probably content to slip away unnoticed, Kragsyde was to have no such fate. Garnering much attention when it was first built, and adored by architects and scholars ever since, the famous shingle-style house has made it impossible for Black to fully disappear. In <b>The House at Lobster Cove</b>, you will see behind the doors of Kragsyde, the house that sheltered and shaped him, and continued to tell his story long after both were gone. <br><br> Using characters, letters and events from history, Jane Goodrich's first novel is part family saga and part love story, as well as an engaging personal journey for the author. Although Kragsyde was demolished in 1929, it was later rebuilt, in every detail, by Goodrich and her husband, doing all the work themselves on an island in Maine. A special feature of this edition is the letterpress printed cover and title page, hand printed on 100% cotton paper at the author's studios at Saturn Press in Maine.</p><p>Jane Goodrich, a co-founder of Saturn Press, is a native of New England. A lifelong love of the 19th century has inspired her work as a designer, builder, printer, and storyteller. George Nixon Black&#39;s Kragsyde, first built on the North Shore of Massachusetts, was later demolished and rebuilt in every detail by Goodrich and her husband, doing all the work themselves, on an island in Maine. Writing from a room that sits above Kragsyde&#39;s famous arch, Goodrich has penned The House at Lobster Cove, as her first novel, a vividly imagined and historically accurate picture of a man who has long inspired her.Fresh out of college and full of energy, Jane Goodrich set out to rebuild one of the finest and most elegant homes she&#x2019;d ever laid eyes on. Nearly 40 years later, long after completing a replica of that magnificent home on Swan&#x2019;s Island in Maine, Goodrich has written a novel about the home&#x2019;s original occupant, a mysterious Boston philanthropist named George Nixon Black. Published by Massachusetts-based Benna Books, the novel is a fictional retelling of Black&#x2019;s life, though it&#x2019;s all mostly true. She changed no names and created only one character, because Goodrich believed Black needed a strong female presence in his life. She thought about writing a biography, but a novel gave her more latitude and suited her style and imagination. Writing a novel is like making a painting, she said. Writing a biography is like taking a photograph. She prefers painting. Like the subject of her novel, Goodrich lives a quiet life on Swan&#x2019;s Island. Using design skills that she learned in college, Goodrich cofounded Saturn Press on the island in 1986 and produces letterpress-printed craft cards on antique presses. Between the house and the book, Black has occupied Goodrich&#x2019;s mind for most of 40 years.

Drawing on her years of research, Goodrich lifts George Nixon Black - the enigmatic owner of "Kragsyde" - from the shadows of history, chronicling his childhood in rural Maine, his youthful adventures on the Grand Tour, and his constrained, frustrating life as the only son of one of the wealthiest men in Boston. The House at Lobster Cove stirs and fascinates, with evocative descriptions of the Civil War, Gilded Age architecture and society, and an enduring romance with a cousin of the last Queen of Hawaii. -Bret Morgan, author of Shingle Style: Houses by the Sea (Bret Morgan <i>Bret Morgan, author of Shingle Style: Houses by the Sea</i>)<br><br>"...enthralling first novel . . . this book is about much more than the building of a summer house by a rich Bostonian (the city's biggest taxpayer in his day).

Serenade to the Big Bird portrays the tragedy of war, and specifically the loss to the world of a fine, sensitive, talented writer who had only a short time to prove his merit. He died at twenty-three.</p><p>Bert Stiles was a prolific and highly talented writer. While still in college he had several stories published in the Saturday Evening Post, Colliers and other magazines. He was way ahead of his time. He wrote about The United Nations while it was still in the planning stage. He wrote about racial inequities and the environment long before such topics were popular. His college classmate Roland Dickison and Robert Cooper have collected many of his manuscripts and published them in separate publications. When we consider that Bert Stiles died at the young age of twenty three, the magnitude and scope of his writing is truly outstanding.Bert Stiles was a highly talented writer who flew as a pilot with the United States Army Air Corps. He first flew a tour of duty as a co-pilot in heavy bombers with the 91st Bomb Group. After completing his tour of duty he volunteered for another tour of duty in fighter aircraft. He was assigned to a P-51 Squadron. However, he took one month off during the late summer of 1944 and wrote Serenade to the Big Bird. Tragically, three months later he was killed in action on an escort raid to Hanover. His mother recovered the manuscript from his personal effects an acquired a publisher. Serenade to the Big Bird was first published in 1947. Now in its fifth printing, it has become a classic tale of the air war in Europe. Bert Stiles tells the story as it was, while it was happening. <p>The author is buried in the Ardennes Cemetery near Liege Belgium. One hundred four fallen airmen from the 91st Bomb Group are buried beside Bert Stiles in this military cemetery. Though their lips are stilled, Bert's words live on, and he has become the unofficial spokesman for every one of his fallen comrades.</p></p><h2>Shoulder the Sky: A Novel (World War I)</h2><p>In the firmament of great historical novelists, Anne Perry is a star of the greatest magnitude. First there were her acclaimed Victorian mysteries, sparkling with passion and suspense. Now readers have embraced this bestselling new series of World War I novels&#x2013;which juxtapose the tranquil life of the English countryside with the horrors of war.<br><br>By April of 1915, as chaplain Joseph Reavley tends to the soldiers in his care, the nightmare of trench warfare is impartially cutting down England&#x2019;s youth. On one of his rescue forays into no-man&#x2019;s-land, Joseph finds the body of an arrogant war correspondent, Eldon Prentice. A nephew of the respected General Owen Cullingford, Prentice was despised for his prying attempts to elicit facts that would turn public opinion against the war. Most troublesome to Joseph, Prentice has been killed not by German fire but, apparently, by one of his own compatriots. What Englishman hated Prentice enough to kill him? Joseph is afraid he may know, and his sister, Judith, who is General Cullingford&#x2019;s driver and translator, harbors her own fearful suspicions.<br><br>Meanwhile, Joseph and Judith&#x2019;s brother, Matthew, an intelligence officer in London, continues his quiet search for the sinister figure they call the Peacemaker, who, like Eldon Prentice, is trying to undermine the public support for the struggle&#x2013;and, as the Reavley family has good reason to believe, is in fact at the heart of a fantastic plot to reshape the entire world. An intimate of kings, the Peacemaker kills with impunity, and his dark shadow stretches from the peaceful country lanes of Cambridgeshire to the twin hells of Ypres and Gallipoli.<br><br>In this mesmerizing series, Anne Perry has found a subject worthy of her gifts. Illuminating the murderous conflict whose violence still resounds in our consciousness&#x2013;as well as the souls of men and women who lived it&#x2013;<i>Shoulder the Sky</i> is a taut, inspiring masterpiece.</p><p><b>Anne Perry</b> is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the William Monk novels, including <i>Revenge in a Cold River</i> and <i>Corridors of the Night,</i> and the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including <i>Murder on the Serpentine </i>and <i>Treachery at Lancaster Gate</i>. She is also the author of a series of five World War I novels, as well as thirteen holiday novels, most recently <i>A Christmas Return,</i> and a historical novel, <i>The Sheen on the Silk,</i> set in the Ottoman Empire. Anne Perry lives in Scotland and Los Angeles.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>It was shortly after three in the afternoon. Joseph Reavley was half asleep in the April sun, his back to the pale clay wall of the trench, when he heard the angry voices.<br><br>&#x201c;They be moi boots, Tucky Nunn, an&#x2019; you know that well as Oi do! Yours be over there wi&#x2019; holes in &#x2019;em!&#x201d; It was Plugger Arnold, a seasoned soldier of twenty, big-boned, a son of the village blacksmith. He had been in Flanders since the outbreak of war in August. Although he was angry, he kept his voice low. He knew it carried in the afternoon stillness when the men snatched the three or four hours of sleep they could.<br><br>The German trenches were only seventy yards away across this stretch of the Ypres Salient. Anyone foolish enough to reach a hand up above the parapet would be likely to get it shot. The snipers seldom needed a second chance. Added to which, getting yourself injured on purpose was a court-martial offense.<br><br>Tucky Nunn, nineteen and new this far forward, was standing on the duckboards that floored the trench. They were there to keep the men&#x2019;s feet above the icy water that sloshed around, but they seldom worked. The water level was too high. Every time you thought it was drying out at last, it rained again.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; Tucky said, his eyebrows raised. &#x201c;Fit me perfect, they do. Didn&#x2019;t see your name on &#x2019;em. Must &#x2019;ave wore off.&#x201d; He grinned, making no move to bend and unlace the offending boots and hand them back.<br><br>Plugger was sitting half sideways on the fire-step. A few yards away the sentry was standing with his back to them, staring through the periscope over the wire and mud of no-man&#x2019;s-land. He could not afford to lose concentration even for a moment, regardless of what went on behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;s moi boots,&#x201d; Plugger said between his teeth. &#x201c;Take &#x2019;em off yer soddin&#x2019; feet an&#x2019; give &#x2019;em back to me, or Oi&#x2019;ll take &#x2019;em off yer and give yer to the rats!&#x201d;<br><br>Tucky bounced on the balls of his feet, hunching his shoulders a little. &#x201c;You want to try?&#x201d; he invited.<br><br>Doughy Ward crawled out of his dugout, fully dressed, as they all were: webbing and rifle with bayonet attached. His fair-skinned face was crumpled with annoyance at being robbed of any part of his few hours of sleep. He glared at Joseph. &#x201c; &#x2018;Thou shalt not steal.&#x2019; Isn&#x2019;t that right, Chaplain?&#x201d;<br><br>It was a demand that even here in the mud and the cold, amid boredom and sporadic violence, Joseph should do his job and stand for the values of justice that must remain, or all this would sink into a purposeless hell. Without right and wrong there was no sanity.<br><br>&#x201c;Oi didn&#x2019;t steal them!&#x201d; Tucky said angrily. &#x201c;They were . . .&#x201d; He did not finish the sentence because Plugger hit him, a rolling blow that caught the side of his jaw as he ducked and struck back.<br><br>There was no point in shouting at them, and the sound would carry. Added to which Joseph did not want to let the whole trench know that there was a discipline problem. Both men could end up on a charge, and that was not the way for a chaplain to resolve anything. He moved forward, careful to avoid being struck himself, and grasped hold of Tucky, taking him off balance and knocking him against the uprights that held the trench wall.<br><br>&#x201c;The Germans are that way!&#x201d; he said tartly, jerking his head back toward the parapet and no-man&#x2019;s-land beyond.<br><br>Plugger was up on his feet, slithering in the mud on the duckboards, his socks filthy and sodden. &#x201c;Good oidea to send him over the top, Captain, where he belongs! But not in moi boots!&#x201d; He was floundering toward them, arms flailing as if to carry on the fight.<br><br>Joseph stepped between them, risking being caught by both, the worst part of which would be that then a charge would be unavoidable. &#x201c;Stop it!&#x201d; he ordered briskly. &#x201c;Take the boots off, Nunn!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Chaplain,&#x201d; Plugger responded with a smile of satisfaction.<br><br>Tucky stood unmoving, his face set, ignoring the blood. &#x201c;They ain&#x2019;t his boots oither!&#x201d; he said sullenly, his eyes meeting Joseph&#x2019;s.<br><br>A man appeared around the dogleg corner. No stretch of the trench was more than ten or twelve yards long, to prevent shellfire taking out a whole platoon of men&#x2014;or a German raiding party making it through the wire. They were steep-sided, shored up against mud slides, and barely wide enough for two men to pass each other. The man coming was tall and lean with wide shoulders, and he walked with a certain elegance, even on the sloping duckboards. His face was dark, long-nosed, and there was a wry humor in it.<br><br>&#x201c;Early for tea, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he asked, his eyes going from one to another.<br><br>Tucky and Plugger reluctantly stood to attention. &#x201c;Yes, Major Wetherall,&#x201d; they said almost in unison.<br><br>Sam Wetherall glanced down at Plugger&#x2019;s stockinged feet, his eyebrows raised. &#x201c;Thinking of creeping up on the cook, are you? Or making a quick recce over the top first?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Soon as Oi get moi boots back from that thievin&#x2019; sod, Oi&#x2019;ll put &#x2019;em on again,&#x201d; Plugger replied, gesturing toward Tucky.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d wash them first if I were you,&#x201d; Sam advised with a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Oi will,&#x201d; Plugger agreed. &#x201c;Oi don&#x2019;t want to catch nothin&#x2019;!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I meant your feet,&#x201d; Sam corrected him.<br><br>Tucky Nunn roared with laughter, in spite of the bruise darkening on his jaw where Plugger had caught him.<br><br>&#x201c;Whose boots are they?&#x201d; Joseph asked, smiling as well.<br><br>&#x201c;Moine!&#x201d; both men said together.<br><br>&#x201c;Whose boots are they?&#x201d; Joseph repeated.<br><br>There was a moment&#x2019;s silence.<br><br>&#x201c;Oi saw &#x2019;em first,&#x201d; Plugger answered.<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t take them,&#x201d; Tucky pointed out. &#x201c;If you &#x2019;ad, you&#x2019;d &#x2019;ave them now, wouldn&#x2019;t you!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Solomon.&#x201d; Sam looked at Joseph, his mouth pulled into an ironic twist.<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Joseph said decisively. &#x201c;Left boot, Nunn. Right boot, Arnold.&#x201d;<br><br>There was considerable grumbling, but Tucky took off the right boot and passed it over, reaching for one of the worn boots where Plugger had been sitting.<br><br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t have had them off now anyway,&#x201d; Sam said disapprovingly. &#x201c;You know better than that. What if Fritz&#x2019;d made a sudden attack?&#x201d;<br><br>Plugger&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up, his blue eyes wide open. &#x201c;At half past three in the afternoon? It&#x2019;s teatoime in a minute. They may be soddin&#x2019; Germans, but they&#x2019;re not uncivilized. They still got to eat an&#x2019; sleep, same as us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You stick your head up above the parapet, and you&#x2019;ll find he&#x2019;s nowhere near asleep, I promise you,&#x201d; Sam warned.<br><br>Tucky was about to reply when there was a shouting about twenty yards along the line, and a moment later a young soldier lurched around the corner, his face white. He stared at Sam.<br><br>&#x201c;One of your sappers has taken half his hand off!&#x201d; he said, his voice high-pitched and jerky.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is he, Charlie?&#x201d; Joseph said quickly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get him to the first-aid post.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam was rigid. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; He started forward, pushing ahead of both of them, ignoring the rats scattering in both directions.<br><br>Charlie Gee swiveled and went on his heels. Joseph stopped to duck into the connecting trench leading back to the second line, and pick out a first-aid pack in case they needed more than the field dressing the wounded man should be carrying himself.<br><br>When he caught up with them Sam was bent over, one arm around a man sitting on the duckboards. The sapper was rocking back and forth, clutching the stump of his hand to his chest, scarlet blood streaming from it.<br><br>Joseph had lost count of how many wounded and dead he had seen, but each man&#x2019;s horror was new, and real, and it looked as if in this case the man might have lost a good deal of his right hand.<br><br>Sam was ashen, his jaw clenched so tight the muscles stood out like cords. &#x201c;We have to see it, Corliss!&#x201d; His voice shook in spite of everything he could do to steady it. &#x201c;We have to stop the bleeding!&#x201d; He looked at Joseph, his eyes desperate.<br><br>Joseph tore open the dressing and, speaking gently to the injured man, took his hand and without examining it, pressed the bandage and the lint over the streaming wound, then bound it as well as he could. He had very little idea how many fingers were left.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, ol&#x2019; feller,&#x201d; Charlie said, trying to help Corliss to his feet. &#x201c;Oi&#x2019;ll get you back to the doc&#x2019;s and they&#x2019;ll do it for you proper.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam climbed to his feet and pulled Joseph aside as Charlie and Corliss stumbled past.<br><br>&#x201c;Joe, can you go with them?&#x201d; Sam said urgently. He swallowed, gulping. &#x201c;Corliss is in a hell of a state. He&#x2019;s been on the edge of funking it for days. I&#x2019;ve got to find out what happened, put in a report, but the medics&#x2019;ll ask him what caused it. . . . Answer for him, will you?&#x201d; He stopped, but it was painfully apparent he wanted to say more.<br><br>Suddenly Joseph understood. Sam was terrified the man had injured himself deliberately. Some men panicked, worn down by fear, cold, and horror, and put their hands up above the parapet precisely so a sniper would get them. A hand maimed was &#x201c;a Blighty one,&#x201d; and they got sent home. But if it was self-inflicted, it was considered cowardice in the face of the enemy. It warranted a court-martial, and possibly even the death sentence. Corliss&#x2019;s nerves may have snapped. It happened to men sometimes. Anything could trigger a reaction: the incessant noise of bombardment, the dirt, body lice. For some it was waking in the night with rats crawling over your body&#x2014;or worse, your face. The horror of talking one moment to a man you had grown up with, the next seeing him blown to bits, perhaps armless and legless but still alive, taking minutes of screaming in agony to die. It was more than some could take. For others it was the guilt of knowing that your bullet, or your bayonet, was doing the same to a German you had never met, but who was your own age, and essentially just like you. Sometimes they crept over no-man&#x2019;s-land at night and swapped food. Occasionally you could even hear them singing. Different things broke different men. Corliss was a sapper. It could have been the claustrophobia of crawling inside the tunnels under the earth, the terror of being buried alive.<br><br>&#x201c;Help him,&#x201d; Sam begged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go . . . and they won&#x2019;t believe me anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Joseph did not hesitate. He grasped Sam&#x2019;s arm for an instant, then turned and made his way back over the duckboards to the opening of the communication trench. Charlie Gee and Corliss were far enough ahead of him to be out of sight around one of the numerous dogleg bends. He hurried, his feet slithering on the wet boards. In some places chicken wire had been tacked over them to give a grip, but no one had bothered here. He must catch up with them before they reached the supply trench and someone else started asking questions.</p><h2>Eclipse</h2><p>The third book in a vampire love saga. As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger.</p><p>Stephenie Meyer is the author of the #1 bestselling Twilight Saga and <i>The Host</i>.

While there is agreement that men and women share equally in the privilege of being made in God's image, some views of manhood and womanhood blur God-given gender distinctions.</p><p>Wayne Grudem assembled a team of distinguished writers to show how egalitarian views destroy God's ideal for your relationships, marriage, and life purposes.

This book is an ode to love and language and food and what right now sounds like. It&#x2019;s also a meditation on what it means to belong on/to this planet/universe. Delivered in headlines, texts, conversations, song lyrics, puns, rhymes, and speculation about the possibility of life on other planets, Tommy Pico&#x2019;s&nbsp;Feed&nbsp;sprawls across time and this country. It is endlessly inventive and stays fun while bringing the heat and weight of a world we&#x2019;re all helplessly watching burn down. As his character/AKA Teebs says of Oakland rapper Two $hort, the same is true of Tommy Pico in this book and in general: Vigor is the art he argues for.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tommy Orange</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tommy Pico&#x2019;s <em>Feed</em> is the poet&#x2019;s most ambitious work yet. Part tour diary, part tracklist, part play, part by part Pico tops his epic run of books off with this gut-wrenching, gut-busting, gutter mouth offering of a body in lust, in isolation, in danger, in memory, in future and all the transits between. <em>Feed</em> is a feast of Pico&#x2019;s signature intellect, humor, and linguistic demolition&#x2015;all sharper than ever. No one corrals our day&#x2019;s chaos like Pico, who serves it up to us as some of the wildest verse the world has ever seen. Bon app�tit, bitches.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Danez Smith</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tommy Pico is indiscreet, rambunctious, spunky and operatic, on the page and off, a dynamo, a force, a one-man band with one hand behind his back and the other setting a guitar on fire. I feel utterly consumed by his poems, absolutely smitten. This is poetry that makes you sweat.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>DA Powell, author of USELESS LANDSCAPE, OR A GUIDE FOR BOYS</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Feed</em> is an incredibly study in chaos, a plunge into the hectic mind disrupted by headlines that scream tragedy and demand our attention. Pico&#x2019;s use of language insists on carving space for a new quotidian, in bluntly grappling with the ways we use words on the daily, breaking and re-making the art of poetry. This book is inventive, wild, fresh, urgent&#x2015;spanning the author at their most vulnerable and their fiercest. Pico is at the forefront of a new poetics, blazing an unchartable trail that we should all attempt to follow. Surrender to the wild friends, for we are in it, and Pico has us by the tips of our tongues.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Fatimah Asghar, author of IF THEY COME FOR US</strong></p><h2>Wish (Faerieground)</h2><p>Two friends, torn apart.

After all, the restaurant saw the people of a city become more confident in everything from their lifestyles to the food that they chose to eat. And Quentins has a thousand stories to tell. But as Ella uncovers more of what has gone on at Quentins, she begins to wonder whether some secrets should be kept that way...<i>&nbsp;</i><br><br><b>&#x201c;Quentins is not just any Dublin restaurant; it&#x2019;s a place where wedding proposals, business deals, family ties, and friendships are forged (and sometimes broken).&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Seattle Times&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>In Maeve Binchy's timely and topical tale, <i>Quentins</i>, Ella Brady is a documentary filmmaker who wants to bring the tale of the eponymous Dublin restaurant to the screen. Quentins has had its fair share of ups and downs over the years and has become the meeting point for a lot of characters, including some familiar faces from previous Binchy novels. As Ella makes more and more headway with her documentary, the secrets, betrayals, and stories of love that emerge make her question whether or not she wants to bring the tale of Quentins to the screen after all; especially as she is also forced to confront a devastating dilemma from her own past.<p> Regarded by many as the true queen of the romantic Irish drama, Binchy has once again produced another fine page-turner that will please her army of loyal fans and hopefully win her many more. She has a real eye for character and exploring the often painful choices people are forced to make in their everyday lives. This is a tale of normal people, ordinary folk and the heartaches that have made them who they are. Fans will welcome the return of some familiar Binchy characters and Ella is a strong, likeable heroine, a woman who, in exploring the lives of these people, is forced to consider some choices she has made in her own life.

Written from the author's unique perspective as the younger brother of Paramahansa Yogananda, whom he affectionately called Mejda - the Bengali term for one's second eldest brother - it provides an intimate account of the early years of one of the great spiritual leaders of our time. For the millions of readers whose lives have been touched by Yogananda's spiritual classic <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i>, this book can open a new window on his astonishing life.<p>Relating many previously unpublished stories, this fascinating biography presents a fresh view of numerous incidents recounted in <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i>. As Sananda Lal Ghosh explains, Paramahansaji was naturally reticent about referring to his own spiritual attainments when writing his autobiography. <i>Mejda</i> offers a vivid, firsthand chronicle of his remarkable years in India. </p><p>From this engrossing narrative a new portrait emerges of "the Father of Yoga in the West" - a radiant spiritual personality whose life was an inspiring testament to the ageless truth and vitality of India's universal science of God-realization.</p></p><p>Sananda Lal Ghosh (1898 - 1979) was the brother and childhood companion of Paramahansa Yogananda. His deep religious interests and creative spirit found many-sided expression as an artist, photographer, mechanic, architect, musician, and finally as an author. In the late 1950s he painted a portrait of the famous Nobel-prizewinning poet, Rabindranath Tagore, which received worldwide acclaim. Over the years he produced hundreds, perhaps thousands, of photo-portraits of his revered brother for disciples throughout the world. In the same tireless spirit of dedication he worked on the manuscript of this book, which was completed shortly before his passing in 1979.</p><h2>Aramaic Light on the Gospel of Matthew (Aramaic New Testament Series)</h2><p>If you instinctively shy away from &#x201c;commentaries&#x201d;&#x2014; Aramaic Light on the Gospel of Matthew will surprise you! No dull theological seminary textbook, this commentary will appeal to anyone who enjoys a good narrative. It carries you back almost two thousand years, providing a clear perspective of Jesus in the light of his own language, people and times. This inimitable commentary acts as a Near Eastern guide, revealing to the Western mind a more intimate picture of the socio-religious and psychological environment of the period. It&#x2019;s approach is simple, informative, and scholarly without using specialized theological terminology. Each comment is written in narrative form, clarifying the idioms, customs, and manners of Jesus&#x2019; day. This commentary is suitable for use by anyone who is eager to resume acquaintance with Jesus&#x2019; powerful Gospel of the Kingdom. Aramaic Light on the Gospel of Matthew takes you through the heart of the gospel, illuminating difficult and puzzling passages and offering unparalleled insight into the character and behavior of Near Eastern Semites. This is the field of Dr. Errico&#x2019;s and Dr. Lamsa&#x2019;s research and expertise. This volume is more than just a revision of Dr. Lamsa&#x2019;s commentaries, Gospel Light and More Light on the Gospel. Dr. Errico has edited, expanded and annotated these previous works in the new format that Dr. Lamsa desired. In addition, over 50% of this book contains unpublished material that the two of them had drafted just before Dr. Lamsa died in 1975. Dr. Errico completed the comments that they had only outlined and has also added information derived from his continual research in Aramaic word meanings and Near Eastern Semitic studies.</p><p>Dr. Rocco A. Errico, PhD., DD, is an ordained minister, author and lecturer and one of the nations&#x2019;s leading biblical scholars working from the original Aramaic texts. For ten years he studied intensively with Dr. George M. Lamsa, world-renowned native Assyrian scholar of the Scriptures. In 1970 Dr. Errico established the Noohra Foundation, which is dedicated to helping people of all faiths to understand the Near Eastern background and Aramaic interpretation of the Bible. He is the Dean of Biblical Studies for Dr. Barbara King&#x2019;s School of Ministry, Hillside Chapel and Truth Center in Atlanta, Georgia, where he teaches ongoing classes based on the Aramaic texts of the Bible. He also presents an online class one Saturday a month under the auspices of the Aramaic Bible Institute (www.aramaicbibleinstitute.com). Dr. Errico is the recipient of numerous awards and academic degrees, including a doctorate in Letters from the College of Seminarians, The Apostolic Succession of Antioch and the Church of the East&#x2014;American See a doctorate in Divinity from St. Ephrem&#x2019;s Institute in Sweden, and a doctorate in Philosophy from the School of Christianity in Los Angeles. Dr. George M. Lamsa, ThD (1892-1975) was born in a civilization with customs, manners and language almost identical to those in the time of Jesus. His native tongue was full of similar idioms and parables, untouched by the outside world in 1900 years. Dr. Lamsa&#x2019;s formal education began under the priests and deacons of the ancient Church of the East and he later graduated with the highest honors ever bestowed from the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x2019;s Colleges in Iran and Turkey. After arriving in the United States in his early 20s, Dr. Lamsa worked by day as a printer, and by night he went to school. He later studied at the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia, and at Dropsie College in Philadelphia. It was his own inner compulsion, and the urging of hundreds who heard him lecture, that drove him forward and brought about&#x2014;after 30 years of labor, research and study&#x2014;his translation of the Holy Bible from a branch of the ancient Aramaic language that the earliest Christians used....solid Gospel wisdom, based on the language and culture in the Near East of the First century. -- <i>Frank C.Tribbe, Journal Editor: Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship </i><br><br>Aramaic Light on the Gospel of Matthew is superb. -- <i>Rev. Carol E. Parrish-Harra, Sancta Sophia Seminary </i><br><br>Most challenging and informative creation. Excellent! We are telling all our St. Thomas Christians about this vital resource. -- <i>Patriarch Mar Joseph Vredenburgh, The Federation of St. Thomas Christians </i></p><h2>Hopi Runners: Crossing the Terrain between Indian and American (Culture America)</h2><p>In the summer of 1912 Hopi runner Louis Tewanima won silver in the 10,000-meter race at the Stockholm Olympics. In that same year Tewanima and another champion Hopi runner, Philip Zeyouma, were soundly defeated by two Hopi elders in a race hosted by members of the tribe. Long before Hopis won trophy cups or received acclaim in American newspapers, Hopi clan runners competed against each other on and below their mesas&#x2014;and when they won footraces, they received rain. <i>Hopi Runners</i> provides a window into this venerable tradition at a time of great consequence for Hopi culture. The book places Hopi long-distance runners within the larger context of American sport and identity from the early 1880s to the 1930s, a time when Hopis competed simultaneously for their tribal communities, Indian schools, city athletic clubs, the nation, and themselves.<br><br>Author Matthew Sakiestewa Gilbert brings a Hopi perspective to this history. His book calls attention to Hopi philosophies of running that connected the runners to their villages; at the same time it explores the internal and external forces that strengthened and strained these cultural ties when Hopis competed in US marathons. Between 1908 and 1936 Hopi marathon runners such as Tewanima, Zeyouma, Franklin Suhu, and Harry Chaca navigated among tribal dynamics, school loyalties, and a country that closely associated sport with US nationalism. The cultural identity of these runners, Sakiestewa Gilbert contends, challenged white American perceptions of modernity, and did so in a way that had national and international dimensions. This broad perspective linked Hopi runners to athletes from around the world&#x2014;including runners from Japan, Ireland, and Mexico&#x2014;and thus, <i>Hopi Runners</i> suggests, caused non-Natives to reevaluate their understandings of sport, nationhood, and the cultures of American Indian people.</p><p>Matthew Sakiestewa Gilbert is professor American Indian studies and history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is the author of <i>Education beyond the Mesas: Hopi Students at Sherman Institute, 1902&#x2013;1929</i>."A fine example of interdisciplinary scholarship, this study demonstrates how sports&#x2014;broadly conceived&#x2014;can provide a window on history. Moreover, it reveals how Native people charted a course through difficult times and in circumstances beyond their control."&#x2014;<i><b>Choice</b></i><br><br>"<i>Hopi Runners</i> is much more than an exquisite history of sport; it is a masterful interpretation of culture, identity, and power in motion. It elevates our appreciation for athletes and athletic traditions often forgotten while deepening our understanding of the social worlds that created and celebrated them. The book shines as an example of the power of thinking of indigenous achievements, interpretations, and actors in context. Indeed, one of the greatest strengths and pleasures of this book lies in its counter-readings that both draw on dominant accounts and unsettle them, unpacking preoccupations and biases, highlighting silences, and rerouting indigenous peoples and perspectives."--<b>C. Richard King</b>, author of <i>Redskins: Insult and Brand</i><p>"Humility in Hopi culture is a highly valued character trait; it is at the core of Hopi identity, continuity and survival. This book opens a window into how Hopi running and the concept of humility are intertwined. The author&#x2019;s intent in featuring &#x201c;the great Hopi runners of the past&#x201d; (1886&#x2013;1930s) to examine how they &#x201c;navigated between tribal dynamics, school loyalties and country&#x201d; goes beyond to reveal the implicitly embodied but explicitly lived nature of humble origins and dictates. In the Hopi perspective, these individuals as , runner scouts as well as messengers, assumed a purposeful role captured in the Hopi word, <i>m�ataknawisa</i>&#x2014;to go out into the larger world to reveal and demonstrate&#x2014;this understanding of running and expression of humility. By highlighting these individual Hopi runners, the author brings important attention to the profound cultural significance of Hopi running; it is the source of resilience and persistence that encompasses purpose, faith and discipline amidst the exploitive landscape of the American sports context. This book is a wonderful contribution to the emerging body of scholarship on Indigenous/American Indian/Hopi knowledge."&#x2014;<b>Sheilah E.

Taking his fishing hobby to near metaphysical levels, Ted Leeson tells about his passions: rivers, trout, and fly fishing. With wry humor and rare insight, he explores questions that engage most fishermen: What is it about rivers that draws us so irresistibly, and why does fly fishing seem such an aptly suited response? Above all, <b>The Habit of Rivers </b>is about ways of seeing the wonderfully textured world that emanates from a river.</p><p>With wry humor and rare insight, The Habit of Rivers tells the story of Leeson&#39;s passion for rivers, trout, and fly fishing, and his experiences as a newcomer to the Pacific Northwest - &#34;the land of unceasing seasons.&#34; Leeson looks beneath the surface of fly fishing to explore questions that engage most fishermen: What is the strange gravity of a trout stream? Why are we so irresistibly drawn to rivers? Why does fly fishing seem such an aptly suited response? Above all, The Habit of Rivers is a book about ways of seeing the wonderfully textured world that emanates from a river. In pursuing these paths, Leeson finds everything from salmon, steelhead, and trout, to drift boats, art, insects, gravity, death, philosophy, books, fly tying, and microbreweries - and links them together with an intelligence that is provocative, witty, and illuminating. The Habit of Rivers begins with a deep respect for trout and trout streams, and ends in wisdom earned by hard and faithful attention to the natural world.<b>Ted Leeson</b>'s essays and articles have appeared in <i>Fly Fisherman</i>, <i>Field &amp; Stream</i>, <i>The Utne Reader</i>, <i>Gray's Sporting Journal</i>, <i>Men's Journal</i>, and <i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i>.

In this profoundly beautiful and intensely moving lament, artist and writer Karen Green conjures the inscrutable space of love and loss, clarity and contradiction, sense and madness. She summons memory and the machination of the interior mind with the emotional acuity of music as she charts her passage through the devastation of her husband&#x2019;s suicide. In crystalline fragments of text, Green&#x2019;s voice is paradoxically confessional and non-confessional: moments in her journey are devastating but also luminous, exacting in sensation but also ambiguous and layered in meaning. Her world is haunted by the unnameable, and yet she renders that world with poetic precision in her struggle to make sense of not only of death but of living. In counterpoint, tiny visual collages punctuate the text, each made of salvaged language and scraps of the material world&#x2015;pages torn from books, bits of paper refuse, drawings and photographs, old postage stamps and the albums which classify them. Each collage--and the creative act of making it--evinces the reassembling of life. A breathtaking lyric elegy, <i>Bough Down</i> uses music and silence, color and its absence, authority of experience and the doubt that trembles at its center to fulfill a humane artistic vision. This is a lapidary, keenly observed work, awash with the honesty of an open heart.</p><p>That her husband was a public figure (though if you don't know who, don't look it up until you&#x2019;ve read the book) means that there was a very public reaction to his death. But Bough Down brings to the reader her more private sadness, the complexity of emotion that surrounds mental illness and suicide and grief, the identification and sympathy and anger that she went through trying to figure out what her life might look like after such loss. Green starts simply by observing the materials of her life, of his life, of their lives together. What she ends up giving us is so much more. (Emily Pullen <i>The Improbable</i>)<br><br>Grief emphatic, grief redeeming, grief protacted, grief abraded all intertwine in this funny, prickly memoir. (David Denby <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;KAREN GREEN&#x2019;S NEW &#x2015; and incredibly, her first &#x2015; book Bough Down, from Siglio Press, is an astonishment. It is one of the most moving, strange, original, harrowing, and beautiful documents of grief and reckoning I&#x2019;ve read. The book consists of a series of prose poems, or individuated chunks of poetic prose, interspersed with postage-stamp-sized collages made by Green, who is also a visual artist. Collectively the text bears witness to the 2008 suicide of her husband, the writer David Foster Wallace, and its harrowing aftermath for Green. &#x201c; (Maggie Nelson <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>The book hints at healing, but with such stream-of-consciousness prose and a traumatic subject, closure may be too much to hope for: Green&#x2019;s last words on the subject are an abrupt: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wrap this up.&#x201d; (Editors <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>)<br><br>To those who have lived through such a loss, this punishingly tender elegy may have totemic power, but to every reader Green&#x2019;s empathy, her humor, and her observations&#x2015;so clear they are nearly hallucinatory&#x2015;are strong medicine. (Andi Mudd <i>The Believer</i>)<br><br>This exquisite book is an impressionistic miracle, an assemblage of short text fragments and collages by an artist trying to make sense of her husband's suicide. That this husband was David Foster Wallace is beautifully beside the point, for the focus here is on the experience, the bleak and necessary journey of grief. Green is a pointed writer, open and at a distance all at once. The effect is unsettling, elliptical, necessarily open-ended and at times brutally revealing: a necessary explication of loss as a fact of daily life.

In his massive and highly publicized <em>The Death of the Messiah</em>, Raymond Brown -- while clearly rejecting anti-Semitism -- never questions the essential historicity of the passion stories. Yet it is these stories, in which the Jews decide Jesus' execution, that have fueled centuries of Christian anti-Semitism. <p> Now, in his most controversial book, John Dominic Crossan shows that this traditional understanding of the Gospels as historical fact is not only wrong but dangerous. Drawing on the best of biblical, anthropological, sociological and historical research, he demonstrates definitively that it was the Roman government that tried and executed Jesus as a social agitator. Crossan also candidly addresses such key theological questions as "Did Jesus die for our sins?" and "Is our faith in vain if there was no bodily resurrection?" </p><p> Ultimately, however, Crossan's radical reexamination shows that the belief that the Jews killed Jesus is an early Christian myth (directed against rival Jewish groups) that must be eradicated from authentic Christian faith.</p></p><p>Bestselling author John Dominic Crossan's riveting and definitive historical investigation into the nature and meaning of Jesus' death. <p>Praise for Crossan's previous works: </p><p>"With his work on Jesus, Crossan joins the ranks of the truly great biblical scholars of the twentieth century."

Aster Bunnymund and the Warrior Eggs at the Earth&#x2019;s Core CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br><br> We Begin Our Story with a Story<p></p> <br>IN THE HINTERLANDS OF eastern Siberia was the village where Katherine, North, and Ombric called home. The village of Santoff Claussen felt somewhat lonely without them, but a dozen or so adventurous children played in the enchanted forest that protected their homes from the outside world. The surrounding oak trees were among the largest in the world. Their massive trunks and limbs were a paradise for climbing.<br> <br>Petter, a strong boy of twelve who imagined himself a daring hero, catapulted onto the porch of his favorite tree house. He landed just ahead of his little sister, Sascha. She was testing her latest invention: gloves and shoes that allowed her to scamper up a tree, like a squirrel. But Petter&#x2019;s catapult was faster.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll beat you next time,&#x201d; Sascha said, hoping that a small engine on the heel of each shoe would do the trick.<br> <br>She peered down at the clearing hundreds of feet below. The village&#x2019;s bear, a massive creature, loped around the perimeter of the clearing along with Petrov, the horse of Nicholas St. North. Sascha was wondering if she&#x2019;d ever be allowed to ride Petrov when she spied Tall William, the first son of Old William, squatting on his heels, talking to a group of centipedes. The children of Santoff Claussen had begun to learn the easier insect languages (ant, worm, snail), but Tall William was the first to tackle the more difficult speech of centipede. Sascha pressed a trumpet-shaped sound amplifier to her ear.<br> <br>Tall William reported what the centipedes said, that all was well&#x2014;Pitch, the Nightmare King, was nowhere to be seen. It was a warm summer day, but the memory of that terrible time when Pitch appeared in Santoff Claussen made Sascha shiver as if it were the darkest night in deepest winter.<br> <br>Pitch had once been a hero of the Golden Age, an ancient time when Constellations ruled the universe. His name in those days long ago was General Kozmotis Pitchiner, and he had led the Golden Age Armies in capturing the Fearlings and Dream Pirates who plagued that era. These villains were wily creatures of darkness. When they escaped, they devoured the general&#x2019;s soul, and from that moment on, he hungered for the dreams of innocent children and was known simply as &#x201c;Pitch.&#x201d; He was determined to drain the good from dreams until they became nightmares&#x2014;every last one of them&#x2014;so that the children of Earth and then other worlds would live in terror. And the dreams of the children of Santoff Claussen&#x2014;who had never before known fear or wickedness&#x2014;were the prizes he coveted most.<br> <br>Sascha, like the other children of Santoff Claussen, had survived that terrifying night when Pitch&#x2019;s Fearlings had nearly captured them in the enchanted forest, thanks to a glimmering boy with a moonlit staff who drove back the inky marauders.<br> <br>Now she climbed out onto a branch and hung by her knees, still holding the ear trumpet. The world looks different upside down, but it sounds the same, she thought.<br> <br>Sascha listened once more, then lowered the sound amplifier. The insects had said all was well. Even so, what if Pitch and his Fearlings come back again? She frowned, but before that thought could darken her mood, Petter called out for a new contest. &#x201c;Race you to the clearing!&#x201d; he shouted, leaping for the nearest branch.<br> <br>Scrambling down the tree, Sascha&#x2019;s shoes and gloves now gave her the advantage. She landed proudly in front of Tall William and his brother William the Almost Youngest. Her own brother was still half a tree behind.<br> <br>She was about to brag about her victory when she spotted the stone elves hunkered amidst the vines and trees. There were at least ten statues in total, and they made for an eerie and unsettling sight, some with arms raised, swords at the ready; others frozen in midscream.<br> <br>They were Nicholas St. North&#x2019;s band of outlaws, turned to stone by the Spirit of the Forest. The Spirit had spared North for he alone was true of heart. Rejecting her offer of riches, he had gone to the village&#x2019;s rescue when Pitch attacked again. He then decided to stay in Santoff Claussen, and became their wizard Ombric Shalazar&#x2019;s apprentice.<br> <br>The Spirit of the Forest was just one of the magical barriers their wizard had devised to protect the village when he first created it. He&#x2019;d also conjured up a hundred-foot-tall hedge, the great black bear the size of a house, and the majestic oaks that blocked the advance of anyone who tried to enter Santoff Claussen with ill intent. But none of these had been able to protect the children from the shadows and Fearlings at Pitch&#x2019;s command.<br> <br>Petter and his friend Fog began crossing stick swords with each other, acting out the battle that took place when Nicholas St. North had come face-to-face with Pitch.<br> <br>Everything they knew and loved had seemed lost until North had galloped up to the rescue on Petrov. Though badly wounded, North had been able to drive Pitch away, but the children all worried that the Nightmare King would return. At this very moment Ombric, North, and their friend Katherine were far from Santoff Claussen, searching for the weapon&#x2014;some sort of relic!&#x2014;that would conquer Pitch forever.<br> <br>The youngest William was near tears. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid. Pitch told us he would come back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;North, Ombric, and Katherine will find a way to stop him,&#x201d; Petter told him reassuringly.<br> <br>William the Absolute Youngest wasn&#x2019;t entirely convinced. &#x201c;But Pitch&#x2019;s magic is strong. What if it&#x2019;s stronger than Ombric&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does Ombric always say?&#x201d; Petter asked.<br> <br>The youngest William thought for a moment, then his eyes grew bright. &#x201c;Magic&#x2019;s real power is in believing,&#x201d; he proclaimed, clearly pleased to remember Ombric&#x2019;s very first lesson.<br> <br>And he began to chant. &#x201c;I believe! I believe! I believe!&#x201d;<br> <br>Sascha joined in. &#x201c;I believe! I believe! I believe Katherine and North and Ombric will come home!&#x201d;</p><h2>Start Where You Are: Life Lessons in Getting from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Gardner is encouraging us all to start where we are and dare to make our lives bigger and stronger, more satisfactory, and better.

When Dando anonymously posts a few predictions on a site he dubs The Oracle, it&#x2019;s flooded with queries, all of them variations of three themes: &#x201c;Will I get what I want? How can I get what I want? Why can&#x2019;t I get what I want.&#x201d; What a self-absorbed society we live in, and Soule&#x2019;s novel prompts us to ask a few pointed questions about our own naval gazing and the lure of fate versus free will.

She must be a prostitute, but&#x2014;described as quiet and kempt&#x2014;she doesn&#x2019;t appear to be a fallen woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> What sinister secrets could have made poor Zenia worth killing? And why does the government keep interfering in Monk&#x2019;s investigation?<br> &nbsp;<br> While the public cries out for blood, Monk, his spirited wife, Hester, and their brilliant barrister friend, Oliver Rathbone, search for answers. From dank waterfront alleys to London&#x2019;s fabulously wealthy West End, the three trail an ice-blooded murderer toward the unbelievable, possibly unprovable truth&#x2014;and ultimately engage their adversaries in an electric courtroom duel. But unless they can work a miracle, a monumental evil will go unpunished and an innocent person will hang.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anne Perry has never worn her literary colors with greater distinction than in <i>A Sunless Sea,</i> a heart-pounding novel of intrigue and suspense in which Monk is driven to make the hardest decision of his life.<br><br><b>Includes an excerpt from Anne Perry&#x2019;s next William Monk novel, <i>Blind Justice</i></b><br><br><b>Praise for <i>A Sunless Sea</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anne Perry&#x2019;s Victorian mysteries are marvels.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Unexpected twists and revelations keep the plot humming with typical Anne Perry deception and wit.&#x201d;&#x2014;Bookreporter<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Much more than a whodunit, this book [is] possibly the author&#x2019;s best yet.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</p><p><b>Anne Perry</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the William Monk novels, including&nbsp;<i>Blind Justice</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Sunless Sea</i>, the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including&nbsp;<i>Death on Blackheath</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Midnight at Marble Arch.&nbsp;</i>She is also the author of a series of five World War I novels, as well as eleven holiday novels, most recently&nbsp;<i>A New York Christmas,</i>&nbsp;and a historical novel,&nbsp;<i>The Sheen on the Silk,</i>&nbsp;set in the Ottoman Empire.

The drops thrown from Monk&#x2019;s oars glowed momentarily in the air, like wine, or blood. On the other seat, a yard or so in front of him, Orme leaned forward and threw his weight against the drag of the current. They worked in perfect rhythm, used to each other now; it was the last week of November 1864, nearly two years since Monk had taken command of the Thames River Police at the Wapping Station.<br><br>That was a small victory for him. Orme had been part of the River Police all his adult life. For Monk it was a big adjustment after working first for the Metropolitan Police, and then for himself.<br><br>The peace of his satisfaction was shattered by a scream, which was piercing even above the creak of the oarlocks and the sound of the wash from a passing string of barges breaking on the shore. Monk and Orme both turned toward the north bank and Limehouse Pier, which was no more than twenty yards away.<br><br>The scream came again, shrill with terror, and suddenly a figure appeared, black against the shadowy outline of the sheds and warehouses on the embankment. It was someone in a long coat, waving their arms and stumbling around; it was impossible to tell whether it was a man or a woman.<br><br>With a glance over his shoulder at Monk, Orme dug his oars in again and swung the boat round toward the shore.<br><br>The low clouds were parting and the light became stronger; the figure materialized into a woman in a long skirt, standing on the pier, waving her arms and crying out to them, her words so jumbled in terror they were unintelligible.<br><br>The boat bumped at the steps and Orme tied it up.<br><br>Monk grasped the closest wooden beam and clambered out, going up the steps as fast as he could. When he got to the top he saw that the woman was now sobbing and putting her hands to her face as if to block out all possible vision.<br><br>Monk looked around. He could see no one else, nothing to cause such hysterical fear. Nor could he immediately see any evidence of a threat to the woman. The pier was empty except for her and Monk, and then Orme, coming up the steps.<br><br>Monk took her arm gently. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asked, his voice firm. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>She pulled away from him and swung round, jabbing her finger toward a heap of rubbish, which was slowly becoming more visible in the spreading morning light.<br><br>Monk walked over to it, his stomach clenching when he realized that what he had taken for torn canvas was actually the sodden skirt of a woman, her body so mutilated it was not instantly recognizable as human. There was no need to wonder if she was dead. She was twisted over, half on her back, her blue, sightless eyes turned up to the sky. Her hair was matted, and blood-�soaked at the back. But it was the rest of her body that made his gorge rise and choked the breath in his throat. Her belly was ripped open, and her entrails were torn out and laid like pale, skinless snakes across her loins.<br><br>Monk heard Orme&#x2019;s step behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;Dear God!&#x201d; Orme breathed out the words, not as a blasphemy but a cry for help, for what he saw not to be real.<br><br>Monk swallowed hard and grasped Orme&#x2019;s shoulder for a moment. Then, stumbling a little on the rough boards of the pier, he went back to the woman, who was now standing trembling uncontrollably.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know who she is?&#x201d; he said softly.<br><br>The woman shook her head, trying to push him away, but there was no strength in her. &#x201c;No! God &#x2019;elp me, I dunno &#x2019;er. I come lookin&#x2019; fer me man. Bastard&#x2019;s bin out all night! An&#x2019; I find &#x2019;er.&#x201d; She crossed herself as if to ward off the horror. &#x201c;I were terrified it were &#x2019;im, till I saw &#x2019;er, poor cow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You found her just now, when you screamed?&#x201d; Monk asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Ye&#x2019;re River Police, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>She hesitated only a moment. With that thing lying on the boards, almost close enough to touch, perhaps the presence of the police was not such a bad thing as usual.<br><br>&#x201c;Ruby Jones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where do you live, Mrs. Jones?&#x201d; Monk asked. &#x201c;And the truth, please. You don&#x2019;t want us coming looking for you, spreading your name up and down the riverside.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked at his eyes and decided he meant it. &#x201c;Northey Street, be&#x2019;ind the work&#x2019;ouse,&#x201d; she answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at her again, please,&#x201d; he said more gently. &#x201c;Look at her face. It&#x2019;s not too bad. Keep your eyes off the rest. Think if you&#x2019;ve seen her before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t! I don&#x2019; know &#x2019;er!&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not lookin&#x2019; at that thing again. I&#x2019;m gonna see it the rest o&#x2019; me life!&#x201d;<br><br>He did not argue with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you just come down here, or were you waiting here for a while, maybe calling out for your man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I were lookin&#x2019; fer &#x2019;im when I saw that. &#x2019;Ow long d&#x2019;yer think I&#x2019;m gonna stand &#x2019;ere, wi&#x2019; that beside me, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not very long,&#x201d; he agreed. &#x201c;Will you be all right to find your way home, Mrs. Jones?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She jerked her arm sharply out of his grip. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She took a deep breath, then looked toward the body, the horror in her face replaced by pity for a moment. &#x201c;Poor cow,&#x201d; she repeated under her breath.<br><br>Monk let her go and turned to Orme. Together they went back to the corpse. Monk touched her face gently. The flesh was cold. He put a hand down to one of her shoulders, a little under the edge of her dress, feeling for any warmth at all. There was nothing. She had probably been dead all night.<br><br>Orme helped him turn her fully onto her back, completely exposing her ripped-�open belly with its pale entrails bulging out, slimy with blood.<br><br>Orme let out a gasp of horror and for a moment he swayed, even though he was used to corpses. He was familiar with the destruction that time and predators could cause to a body, but this was a barbarity inflicted by man, and it clearly shook him to a point where he could not hide his shock. He coughed, and seemed to choke on his own breath. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better call the police surgeon, and the local station,&#x201d; he said hoarsely.<br><br>Monk nodded, swallowing hard. For a moment he had felt paralyzed with horror and pity. The river he was so used to seemed suddenly cold and strange. Familiar shapes of wharves and wooden piles jutting out of the water closed in on them, seeming threatening as the sharp dawn light distorted their proportions.<br><br>Orme&#x2019;s face was grim. &#x201c;Found her on the pier, means she&#x2019;s our case, sir,&#x201d; he said miserably. &#x201c;But of course land police may know who she is, poor creature. Could be this is domestic. Or, if she&#x2019;s a local prostitute, then perhaps we&#x2019;ve got a lunatic on our hands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Either way we have a lunatic on our hands. Even if it was domestic, no sane man could do this to his wife,&#x201d; Monk said incredulously.<br><br>&#x201c;Who knows? Sometimes I think hate&#x2019;s worse than madness.&#x201d; Orme shook his head. &#x201c;The local station&#x2019;s up the street that way.&#x201d; He indicated with his arm. &#x201c;If you like, I&#x2019;ll stay here with her while you go get them, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>It was the sensible thing to do, since Monk was by far the senior of the two. Still, he was grateful, and said so. He had no wish to remain standing on the pier with the chill of the wind seeping into his bones, keeping watch over that dreadful corpse.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;ll be as quick as I can.&#x201d; He turned and walked rapidly across the pier itself, onto the bank and up toward the street. The sky was pale, the early sun silhouetting the wharves and warehouses. He passed half a dozen stevedores on their way to work. A lamplighter, little more than a gray shadow himself, reached his pole up and snuffed out the last lamp on the street.<br><br>An hour later, Monk and Orme were standing in the local police station, still shivering. There was a chill inside that even hot tea with whisky could not shift. Overstone, the police surgeon, came in, closing the door behind him. He was in his sixties, his gray hair thinning but his face keen. He looked from the local sergeant to Orme, then to Monk. He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bad one,&#x201d; he said very quietly. &#x201c;Most of the mutilation was almost certainly inflicted after death, perhaps all of it. Hard to be absolutely sure. If she wasn&#x2019;t dead already, that would have killed her. But there was still quite a lot of bleeding. She&#x2019;s been ripped open practically from navel to groin.&#x201d;<br><br>Monk looked at the man&#x2019;s strained face and saw the pity in his eyes. &#x201c;If she was dead when that happened, what killed her?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The blow to the back of the head,&#x201d; Overstone replied. &#x201c;Single one. Hard enough to break her skull. Piece of lead pipe, I&#x2019;d say, or something like that.&#x201d;<br><br>He was standing by a wooden desk piled with papers of varying sizes, handwritten by many different people. There were neat bookshelves all around, the contents not stuffed back in place untidily like Monk&#x2019;s own. There were no pictures tacked up on the wall.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing else you can tell us?&#x201d; Monk asked without much hope.<br><br>Overstone&#x2019;s mouth turned down at the corners. &#x201c;Pretty vicious. Lot of weight behind the blow, but it could have been anybody between five and six foot tall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Left hand? Right hand?&#x201d; Monk persisted.<br><br>&#x201c;Probably right-�handed, but could be either. Not much help,&#x201d; Overstone said apologetically. &#x201c;Most people are right-�handed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the . . . mutilation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Long blade: four or five inches, I&#x2019;d say. The cuts are deep, edges pretty sharp. Butcher&#x2019;s knife, sailor&#x2019;s knife&#x2014;�or sailmaker&#x2019;s, for that matter. For God&#x2019;s sake, man, half the chandlers, lightermen, or boatbuilders on the river have something that could have cut the poor woman open. Even a razor! Could be a barber, for that matter. Or any man who shaves himself.&#x201d; He seemed annoyed, as if his inability to narrow his answer stung him like some kind of guilt.<br><br>&#x201c;Or any housewife with a kitchen,&#x201d; the sergeant added.<br><br>Monk glanced at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, sir.&#x201d; The man lowered his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;No need,&#x201d; Monk replied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Could be anyone at all.&#x201d; He turned to Overstone again. &#x201c;What about the woman herself? What can you tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>Overstone shrugged in a gesture of futility. &#x201c;Mid-�forties. Quite healthy, as far as I can tell at a quick examination,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;About five foot four. Fairish hair, bit of gray at the sides. Blue eyes, pleasant face but no remarkable features. Good teeth; I suppose that&#x2019;s unusual. Very white. Slight crossover at the front. I imagine when she smiled that might have been attractive.&#x201d; He looked down at the worn, wooden floor. &#x201c;Sometimes I hate this bloody job!&#x201d;<br><br>Then instantly he lifted his head and the moment&#x2019;s weakness was past. &#x201c;Might be able to say more tomorrow. One thing I can tell you now, with mutilation like this, feelings are going to run very high. As soon as word gets out there&#x2019;ll be fear, anger, then maybe panic. I don&#x2019;t envy you.&#x201d;<br><br>Monk turned to the sergeant. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d best keep it as quiet as you can,&#x201d; he ordered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give any details. The family doesn&#x2019;t need to know them, anyway. If she had one. Don&#x2019;t suppose anyone&#x2019;s been reported missing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; the sergeant replied unhappily. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d; But his words lacked conviction.<br><br>Monk and Orme began near Limehouse Pier and worked along the stretch of Narrow Street, north and south, asking everyone they passed, or in the shops now open, if they had seen anyone going toward the pier the previous evening. Did they know anyone who would return home that way after work, or prostitutes who might seek customers in the area?<br><br>The description of the woman was too general for the police to try to identify her: average height, fair brown hair, blue eyes. And it was too early for anyone to be considered missing.<br><br>They were told of several prostitutes, even one or two people who liked to walk that route, as Narrow Street offered a pleasant view of the river in places. They gathered a dozen names.<br><br>They moved inland up the alleys to Northey Street, Orme in one direction, Monk the other, asking the same questions. It was cold, but the wind had dropped and there was no rain. The low winter sun held no heat.<br><br>Monk was walking along the footpath in Ropemakers Fields when a small woman in gray came out of a door carrying a bundle of laundry balanced on her hip. Monk stopped almost in front of her.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me, do you live here?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>She looked him up and down suspiciously. He was dressed in his usual dark, plain clothes, like those a waterman might wear, but the cut was far better, as if a tailor had made them rather than a chandler. His speech was precise, his voice gentle, and he stood with both grace and confidence.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah . . . ,&#x201d; she said guardedly. &#x201c; &#x2019;Oo are yer as wants ter know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Commander Monk of the River Police,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for anyone who might have heard a fight last night, a woman screaming, perhaps a man shouting at her.&#x201d;<br><br>She sighed and rolled her eyes wearily. &#x201c;If I ever &#x2019;ave a night when I don&#x2019;t &#x2019;ear nobody fighting I&#x2019;ll tell yer. In fact, I&#x2019;ll tell the bleedin&#x2019; newspapers. Now, if yer don&#x2019;t mind, I got work ter do.&#x201d; She pushed her hair out of her eyes and with an irritable gesture began to move past him.<br><br>Monk stepped sideways to block her way. &#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary fight. The woman was killed. Probably an hour or two after dark, on Limehouse Pier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wot kind of woman?&#x201d; she asked him, her face suddenly frightened, mouth drawn tight with a new anxiety.<br><br>&#x201c;About forty or so,&#x201d; he replied. He saw her face relax. He guessed she had daughters who passed that way, possibly even stood around gossiping or flirting. &#x201c;She was an inch or two taller than you, fair hair with a little gray in it. Quite pretty, in a quiet way.&#x201d; He remembered the teeth. &#x201c;Probably a nice smile.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dunno,&#x201d; the woman with the laundry answered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sound like no one as I ever seen. Yer sure she were forty, like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. And she was wearing ordinary clothes, not like a woman looking for business,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;And there was no paint on her face that we could see.&#x201d; He felt callous speaking of her like that. He had robbed her of character, of humor or dreams, likes and dislikes; probably because he wanted to rob her also of her terror. Please God, she did not know what had happened to her afterward. He hoped she had not even seen the blade.<br><br>&#x201c;Then &#x2019;er &#x2019;usband done &#x2019;er in,&#x201d; the woman replied, pulling an expression of weary grief. &#x201c;But I dunno &#x2019;oo she is. Could be anyone.&#x201d; She pushed a few trailing hairs back off her face again and adjusted the weight of the laundry bag on her hip.<br><br>Monk thanked her and moved on. He stopped other people, both men and women, asking the same questions and getting more or less the same answers. No one recognized the woman from Monk&#x2019;s description of her. No one admitted to being anywhere near Limehouse Pier after dark, which at this time of the year was about five o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. The evening had been overcast and damp. Little work was possible after that. No one had heard shouting or anything that sounded like a fight. They were all keen to go home and eat, find a little warmth and possibly a pint or two of ale.<br><br>Monk met up with Orme at noon. They had a cup of hot tea and a ham sandwich at the corner stand, finding a little shelter in a doorway as they spoke, coat collars turned up.<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s seen or heard anything,&#x201d; Orme said unhappily. &#x201c;Not that I expected them to. Word&#x2019;s out already that it&#x2019;s pretty bad. All suddenly blind and deaf.&#x201d; He took another bite of his ham sandwich.<br><br>&#x201c;Not surprising,&#x201d; Monk answered, sipping his tea. It was hot and a bit too strong, but he was used to it. It was nothing like the fresh, fragrant tea at home. This was probably made hours ago, and added to with boiling water every time it got low. &#x201c;Ruby Jones probably told her friends, an...</p><h2>The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash</h2><p>Previously published as <i>The Trillion Dollar Meltdown</i><p>Now fully updated with the latest financial developments, this is the bestselling book that briefly and brilliantly explains how we got into the economic mess that is the Credit Crunch. With the housing markets unravelling daily and distress signals flying throughout the rest of the economy, there is little doubt that we are facing a fierce recession. In crisp, gripping prose, Charles R. Morris shows how got into this mess. He explains the arcane financial instruments, the chicanery, the policy misjudgments, the dogmas, and the delusions that created the greatest credit bubble in world history. Paul Volcker slew the inflation dragon in the early 1980s, and set the stage for the high performance economy of the 1980s and 1990s. But Wall Street's prosperity soon tilted into gross excess. The astronomical leverage at major banks and their hedge fund and private equity clients led to massive disruption in global markets. A quarter century of free-market zealotry that extolled asset stripping, abusive lending, and hedge fund secrecy will go down in flames with it. Continued denial and concealment could cause the crisis to stretch out for years, but financial and government leaders are still downplaying the problem. The required restructuring will be at least as painful as the very difficult period of 1979-1983. <i>The Two Trillion-Dollar Meltdown</i>, updated to include the latest financial developments, is indispensable to understanding how the world economy has been put on the brink.</p></p><p><b>Charles R.

Hamilton&#x2019;s riveting new thriller combines the nail-biting suspense of a serial-killer investigation with clear-eyed scientific and social extrapolation to create a future that seems not merely plausible but inevitable.<br> &nbsp;<br> A century from now, thanks to a technology allowing instantaneous travel across light-years, humanity has solved its energy shortages, cleaned up the environment, and created far-flung colony worlds. The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family&#x2014;composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another, the original three clone &#x201c;brothers&#x201d; have gone their separate ways, and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or maybe not so friendly. At least that&#x2019;s what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who&#x2019;d like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it, whether he solves the crime or not, he&#x2019;ll make enough enemies to ruin his career.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet Sid&#x2019;s case is about to take an unexpected turn: because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra, where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood. The convicted slayer, Angela Tramelo, has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime.<br> &nbsp;<br> Problem is, Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world&#x2019;s political and economic elite . . . all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again. And on St. Libra, Angela, newly released from prison, joins a mission to hunt down the elusive alien, only to learn that the line between hunter and hunted is a thin one.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Great North Road</i><br></b> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A mesmerizing page-turner.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A gripping saga that blends wilderness survival, police procedural, political and social intrigue, and dynastic sf into a mammoth tale featuring believable characters and exceptionally skilled storytelling.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A perfect introduction to [Hamilton&#x2019;s] gifts for character design, dialogue, and sheer, big-idea-driven storytelling.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Compelling and original . . . an awesome novel [with] plenty of action.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;SFRevu</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One very compelling and entertaining science fiction novel.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;SF Site</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Simply brilliant . . . an astonishing achievement.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Tordotcom</b></p><p><b>Peter F.

He lives with his family in England.Sunday, January 13, 2143 <br><br>As midnight approached, the wild neon colors of the borealis storm came shimmering through the soft snow falling gently across Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. It was as if nature were partying along with the rest of the city, providing a jade-and-carmine light show far more elegant than any of the fireworks that had been bursting sporadically above the rooftops since Friday.<br><br>Detective Third Grade Sidney Hurst watched batches of late-night revelers staggering along the frozen pavement, calling out greetings or challenges depending on how toxed up they were. Ice, snow, and slush played havoc with the smartdust embedded in the tarmac, blacking out whole sections of the metamesh that governed the city&#x2019;s roads and therefore making driving with the vehicle&#x2019;s smartauto a dangerous gamble. Sid was steering the unmarked police car manually, but with the auto managing wheel torque on the slippery road. Their snow tires provided reasonable traction, adding to stability and allowing him to make a decent thirty-five kilometers per hour along Collingwood Street past the cathedral. Radar kept throwing proximity symbols across the windshield, designating a warning for the long filthy dunes of snow that the civic snowplows had thrown off the center of the road.<br><br>It had been snowing for two days now, and with the midday temperature spike sticking stubbornly below ten degrees there had been no thaw, allowing the elegant stone Georgian buildings of the city center to become cloaked in Dickensian yuletide splendor. Another proximity warning flashed scarlet, outlining a man running across the road directly in front of the car, laughing and jeering as Sid veered sharply around him. One last obscene gesture, and he was claimed by the swirling snow.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll never last till dawn,&#x201d; Ian Lanagin claimed from the front passenger seat.<br><br>Sid glanced over at his partner. &#x201c;Just another two-oh-one file,&#x201d; he agreed. &#x201c;Welcome back, me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, man, some Sunday-night reunion this is.&#x201d;<br><br>It was crazy so many people being out in this weather; though for once Newcastle&#x2019;s traditional nightclub dress code of T-shirt for the boys and short skirt with glitter heels for the girls had vanished under thick ankle-length coats. It was that cold. He&#x2019;d even glimpsed a few sensible hats, which was almost a first in the fifteen years he&#x2019;d been with the Newcastle police. Even now&#x2014;married with two kids, a career that wasn&#x2019;t quite as dynamic as he&#x2019;d originally envisioned&#x2014;he was slightly surprised he was still in Newcastle. He&#x2019;d followed a girl up here from London, where&#x2014;like every twenty-something law graduate&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been arrowing down the smart and fast career path, alternating jobs between police and private security as if he were an electron bouncing between junction gates. To consummate the grand romantic gesture he applied for a transfer to the local city police, where the career track was equally valid for a couple of years, and the nights could still be spent in bed with Jacinta. Now, fifteen years&#x2019; worth of Siberian winters and Saharan summers later, he was still here, married to Jacinta (which at least showed good judgment), with two kids and a career that had taken the kind of direction he&#x2019;d always sneered at during those long-distant university years when he had passion and conviction and contempt for the way of a world screwed up by the current generation in power and the omnipresent lurking evil of the Zanth. Now experience and its associate wisdom had flicked him onto the more rational track of time-serving and networking to make the final career switch that would see him through the last twenty years before retirement. Fifteen years&#x2019; hard labor had taught him real life had a habit of doing that.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll all sober up by tomorrow,&#x201d; Sid said, switching his gaze back to the road.<br><br>&#x201c;In this town?&#x201d; Ian challenged.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all got jobs now.&#x201d;<br><br>Sid had been as surprised as anyone on Friday morning when Northumberland Interstellar had finally announced they were awarding contracts for five new fusion stations to be built at the Ellington energy complex north of the city. They should have been built years ago, but such was the way with all big projects that decade-long delays were built into corporate decisions as standard. And that was before regulators and politicians started to intervene to prove their worth. It meant the aging tokamaks at Ellington that currently powered the Newcastle gateway to St. Libra would have to be coaxed along way past their original design lifetime. Nobody cared about that, though, and euphoric Geordies had spent the weekend rejoicing about the announcement. It meant a new surge in the monumental tide of money that already coursed along the city streets, money that was channeled at every corner into St. Libra, to be rewarded by the return flow of indispensable bioil back to the old motherworld. Bioil that kept cars and lorries moving across Grande Europe&#x2019;s still-powerful trade arteries; valuable derivations allowing planes to fly and ships to voyage. This contract was nothing more than a ripple on that tide, to be sure, but even so it promised additional revenue for the ancient coal town&#x2019;s manufacturing and service industries, which would devour the digital cash with clever greed to fuel runaway expansion curves on the corporate market graphs. That meant there would be job opportunities at every level. Happy times were officially on their way.<br><br>None knew that better than Newcastle&#x2019;s extensive secondary economy of private lounges, pubs, clubs, pimps, and pushers, who were already salivating at the prospect. Like the rest of the city, they could look forward to a fresh decade of providing a good time to the army of middle-class salary-plus-bonus contractors who would descend upon them. To launch the new era, first drinks had been on the house all this weekend, with second drinks half price.<br><br>They had a lot of takers.<br><br>&#x201c;There it is,&#x201d; Ian Lanagin said, pointing through the symbols scrawling across the windshield as they rolled into Mosley Street.<br><br>Up ahead, at the junction with Grey Street, the blue and green ambulance strobes were shimmering over the fractured ice, casting weird shadows across the walls as they competed with the light-haze seeping out of club doorways and shop windows to illuminate the scene. The big vehicle was parked at an angle, blocking half of the street. Sid nudged their car left, aiming to park behind the ambulance. Proximity radar sketched red caution brackets across the windshield as the front bumper came to a halt a couple of centimeters from the mound of snow thrown up by the plows. He pulled his woolen hat down over his ears, zipped up the front of his quilted leather jacket, and stepped out into the bitter air.<br><br>The cold triggered a tear reflex that he blinked away rapidly, trying to focus on what he could see. Temperature didn&#x2019;t affect the ring of smartcells around his iris that shone minuscule laser pulses down his optic nerves, overlaying the street with sharp display graphics, correlating what he looked at with coordinate locations for the visual log he was running.<br><br>As per protocol, Sid&#x2019;s bodymesh&#x2014;the interconnective network produced by all his smartcells&#x2014;quested a link with Ian, making sure they remained in contact. Ian was represented by a small purple icon at the corner of his sight. The bodymesh also downloaded the visual log through the car&#x2019;s cell and into the police network.<br><br>It was a NorthernMetroServices agency constable who&#x2019;d responded to the distress code. Sid didn&#x2019;t recognize him, though he knew the type well enough. His private Electronic-Identity (e-i) running inside his bodymesh performed a face capture image, logging a man barely into his twenties&#x2014;and walking about with a swagger that was immediately depressing. Give him a uniform and a gram of authority and he thought he was running the city.<br><br>The agency constable&#x2019;s e-i identified him as Kraemer. It immediately quested Sid&#x2019;s e-i, which responded by confirming his own rank as well as activating the badge woven into his jacket, which now glowed a subtle amber. &#x201c;You caught this?&#x201d; Sid asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, sir. On scene fifty seconds after the report was logged.&#x201d;<br><br>Well inside the agency&#x2019;s contracted response period, Sid thought, which would help their stats at renewal time. Of course, it depended when the call was officially logged. NorthernMetroServices also ran the Newcastle emergency response center. It wasn&#x2019;t unknown for the center to alert an agency constable a minute or so before they entered the call into the log, so one of their people could always beat the response time.<br><br>&#x201c;Aggravated thirteen-five. Culprits ran off before I arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fast runners,&#x201d; Sid muttered. &#x201c;Seeing as you were here so quick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thump and grab, man,&#x201d; Kraemer said.<br><br>&#x201c;Victim name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His e-i responded with Kenny Ansetal when I quested it. He was barely conscious; buggers gave him a good kicking. The paramedics have him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Sid walked around to the back of the ambulance, where the paramedics had sat the mugging victim on its egress platform to perform triage. The man was in his early thirties, with facial features that Sid&#x2019;s best estimate placed as a mix of Asian and southern Mediterranean origins&#x2014;which was going to play hell when he came to filling out the ethnicity section of the case file. Of course that opinion&#x2019;s validity was slightly skewed by the amount of blood pouring out of the large gash on the victim&#x2019;s brow. There were deep lacerations on his cheeks, too, which Sid guessed had been caused by ringblades. That much blood tended to obscure the finer features of a person&#x2019;s skin.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, sir,&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re city police. Can you tell me what happened?&#x201d;<br><br>Kenny Ansetal glanced up at him and promptly vomited. Sid winced. The splatter just missed his shoes.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go gather some witness intel,&#x201d; Ian said, already backing off.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a shit,&#x201d; Sid grunted.<br><br>Ian grinned, winked, and turned away. Even with the biting cold, the mugging had drawn a small crowd, who were still hanging around. What for, Sid never did understand. After all this time in the police it was about the one aspect of human instinctual psychology he could never get a handle on: People simply couldn&#x2019;t resist watching someone else&#x2019;s misfortune.<br><br>He waited for a minute while the paramedics managed to spray clotting foam onto Ansetal&#x2019;s forehead wound; then one was sorting out his cheeks while the other performed a quick body check, acting on the information coming out of Ansetal&#x2019;s bodymesh, fingers probing where smartcells were reporting damage. Judging by Ansetal&#x2019;s responses, he&#x2019;d taken some blows to the ribs and a knee. Kicked when he was down, Sid decided. Common enough for a thirteen-five.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, can you tell me what happened?&#x201d;<br><br>This time Kenny Ansetal managed to focus. &#x201c;Bastards,&#x201d; he hissed.<br><br>&#x201c;Try not to move your jaw too much,&#x201d; the paramedic warned as he sealed up a cheek wound.<br><br>Sid recognized the anger and murmured commands to his e-i, which obediently paused the police log using an unauthorized non-department fix he just happened to have in a private cache. &#x201c;Did you recognize your attackers?&#x201d;<br><br>Ansetal shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;How many of them?&#x201d;<br><br>A hand was raised, two fingers extended.<br><br>&#x201c;Male?&#x201d;<br><br>Another nod. &#x201c;Fucking Chinese. Kids it were.&#x201d;<br><br>Sid shook his head fractionally, pleased with himself for predicting Ansetal&#x2019;s answers. Of course, they were common enough. Ansetal didn&#x2019;t know it, but an expletive-linked ethnic identification was legally classified as a racist indicator. That would have opened up a whole world of misery for Ansetal in court if defense council got hold of a log with that on it.<br><br>&#x201c;Did they take anything, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>Ansetal juddered as some more sealant was applied to his cheek. &#x201c;My Apple&#x2014;an i-3800.&#x201d;<br><br>New model personal transnet cell, Sid recalled, and top-end. He was an idiot for carrying it around the city center at this time of night. But idiocy wasn&#x2019;t a crime in itself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to recover your visual records, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d;<br><br>Sid held his hand close to Ansetal&#x2019;s forehead and told his e-i to recover the visual memory. His palm had several smartcells configured for mesh reception, with fixes to handle most formats. The short-term memories from Ansetal&#x2019;s iris smartcells downloaded into the police network. Sid watched what Ansetal had seen, closing his own eyes so he could study the images in the grid. The recording was a blur of motion. Two shadowy figures suddenly appeared, hoods drawn against the cold. Then everything degenerated into smears of motion as the beating began.<br><br>His e-i ran a capture, which showed him both assailants had the same face. Sid grunted at the familiar features: Lork Zai, the Chinese zone star who featured heavily on tabloid show hot lists these days.<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Sid said. &#x201c;Now, Kenny, I&#x2019;m going to give you some unofficial advice. Best if you don&#x2019;t speak again.&#x201d;<br><br>Ansetal gave him a puzzled look. Sid could almost see the middle-class thought processes clicking around behind his blood-painted skin. I&#x2019;m the victim here, why are the police giving me warnings? The answer was simple enough, though they never got it: Never say anything that a lawyer could gain traction on in court&#x2014;so just don&#x2019;t say anything at all.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you got full-comp crime insurance?&#x201d; Judging by the relatively expensive clothes, that was a rhetorical question.<br><br>A cautious nod.<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Use it. Call their emergency address. They&#x2019;ll dispatch a duty lawyer to your hospital. Now, the agency constable is going to accompany you there to take a full statement. Refuse to do so until your lawyer is present. You have that right. You also have the right to refuse blood composition analysis. Understand?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Sid held a gloved finger to his lips.<br><br>A now worried Ansetal nodded. Sid heard a female giggle from somewhere behind the ambulance, and managed to suppress a frown. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do okay, Kenny. Just keep everything aboveboard and official. Wait for your lawyer. That&#x2019;s the way to go.&#x201d;<br><br>Ansetal mouthed: &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Sid murmured instructions to his e-i, clearing the paramedic crew to leave the crime scene, then went back to Kraemer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve authorized Ansetal&#x2019;s release to the hospital. Go with him to take a statement.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, I&#x2019;ll get to it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Give him time to get some treatment and recover. That was a nasty pounding he got there.&#x201d; He produced a friendly smile. &#x201c;It will keep you off the street for a while, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Appreciate that, man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then tomorrow I&#x2019;ll need you to pull all the local mesh sensor memories.&#x201d; He gestured around at the buildings. The brickwork and concrete would be covered in smartdust, some of which might have escaped degradation from the snow. &#x201c;Forward them to my case file. He has insurance, so we can probably drag a budget from the company to run a track on the felons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right you are, man.&#x201d;<br><br>Sid almost smiled&#x2014;the young constable&#x2019;s Geordie accent was nearly as thick as Ian&#x2019;s. The paramedics closed the ambulance doors, firing up the siren as they pulled away. Ian was still talking to the remaining witnesses. Both of them young and female, Sid noticed without the slightest surprise. He&#x2019;d been partnered with Ian for two years now&#x2014;they knew each other better than brothers. As far as Ian was concerned the police force was simply the perfect vocation to legitimately meet girls. Dealing with actual criminals came in a very poor second. With not a little envy, Sid acknowledged Ian was very good at his chosen profession.

He is the creator of the Legacy of Aldenata series, which has become a&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling series with&nbsp;<b>over one million copies in print</b>. The series contains&nbsp;<i>A Hymn Before Battle,</i>&nbsp;<i>Gust Front</i>,&nbsp;<i>When the Devil Dances</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hell&#x2019;s Faire,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Eye of the Storm</i>. Ringo created nationally best-selling techno-thriller novels about Mike Harmon (<i>Ghost</i>,&nbsp;<i>Kildar</i>,&nbsp;<i>Choosers of the Slain</i>,&nbsp;<i>Unto the Breach</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Deeper Blue,&nbsp;</i>and, with Ryan Sear,&nbsp;<i>Tiger by the Tail</i>). His techno-thriller&nbsp;<i>The Last Centurion&nbsp;</i>was also a national bestseller. A more playful twist on the future is found in novels of the Looking-Glass series:&nbsp;<i>Into the Looking Glass</i>,&nbsp;<i>Vorpal Blade</i>,&nbsp;<i>Manxome Foe,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Claws That Catch</i>, the last three in collaboration with Travis S. Taylor. His audience was further entranced with four collaborations alongside fellow&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author David Weber:&nbsp;<i>March Upcountry</i>,<i>&nbsp;March to the Sea</i>,&nbsp;<i>March to the Stars&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>We Few</i>. There are an additional five collaborative spinoffs from the Posleen series:&nbsp;<i>The Hero</i>, written with Michael Z.

And his science-based zombie apocalypse Black Tide Rising series includes&nbsp;<i>Under a Graveyard Sky, To Sail a Darkling Sea, Islands of Rage and Hope</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Strands of Sorrow.&nbsp;</i>A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, Ringo brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction.Michael O'Shea, a fireplug of an iron-pumping ex-soldier, leaves game design behind to train and then lead power-armored infantry in a merciless battle against the equally merciless, centauroid Posleen for the sake of Earth's allies. Several subplots show Ringo's fondness for special ops types and marines, and his experience as a paratrooper shows in the way he handles military small-group politics and disciplinary problems. The subplots point up the potential grimness of Earth finding itself under siege, if not actually under assault. (Don't worry, that will probably come; this book has <i>series</i> written between all the lines.) The interstellar skulduggery is thick, and the final action sequence, occupying a third of the book, juxtaposes power armor, aliens, lasers, and leopard tanks, and is practically impossible not to read in one sitting. An exceedingly impressive first novel is what we have here. Standard military sf based on a standard premise--humans as the desperately needed warrior allies of alien pacifists--it may be, but it is executed with skill, verve, and wit. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I glanced at all the plastic bins and cardboard boxes that needed to be relocated from this space to my new home and pushed up my sleeves. My dream of curling up in front of a fire tonight was never going to happen if I kept dragging my feet.<br><br>As much as I tried, however, I couldn&#x2019;t seem to get going. I flitted from one side of my aunt Ve&#x2019;s garage to the other, accomplishing little as early-October sunlight filtered through grimy windows, spotlighting every dust particle in sight.<br><br>As well as my hesitance.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t known for procrastinating, but today as I transferred all the belongings I&#x2019;d been storing in this space to my new house two doors down the street, I was taking my sweet time.<br><br>My puttering had nothing to do with actually moving the twenty or so boxes and assorted bits of my previous life and everything to do with leaving behind Aunt Ve and the house I&#x2019;d lived in since arriving in this village a little more than a year ago.<br><br>Today was moving day. Tonight, I&#x2019;d sleep in my new bed, under a new roof.<br><br>I&#x2019;d eventually have to deal with the emotions lurking under the surface, but for right now I fortunately had help with the move: My younger sister, Harper, and my aunt Ve had both volunteered to assist with the process.<br><br>&#x201c;It should all go!&#x201d; Velma &#x201c;Ve&#x201d; Devany said, tossing her hands in the air. &#x201c;All of it.&#x201d;<br><br>She wasn&#x2019;t referencing my belongings, though I suspected the ghostly outlines left behind by my moving boxes had triggered the desire to banish everything else from the garage as well.<br><br>&#x201c;A yard sale! Tomorrow, just in time for the weekend crowd.&#x201d; Spinning around, Ve faced me, her golden blue eyes alight with sparks of purpose. Her coppery hair was pulled back in its usual twist, but she&#x2019;d accented the style with a red bandanna. It was tied in a knot at the top of her head like Rosie the Riveter&#x2019;s. Round cheeks glowed with good health as Ve pushed up the sleeves of her white long-sleeved thermal henley and then bent to cuff the hems of her denim overalls. She was in her early sixties and had more energy than I&#x2019;d ever possessed.<br><br>&#x201c;I think she means it,&#x201d; Harper stage-whispered to me, a trace of horror hovering in her voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I mean it,&#x201d; Ve stated firmly. &#x201c;Think of all the space I&#x2019;d have in here if it were empty. I could turn the garage into a craft studio!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t craft,&#x201d; Harper pointed out as she wrestled a tall box into the driveway. The box was almost as big as she was. At just five feet, twenty-four-year-old Harper personified Shakespeare&#x2019;s line, &#x201c;though she be but little, she is fierce.&#x201d; Her brown eyes glinted in the sunlight as she looked back at us. &#x201c;Well, not in a <i>studio</i> kind of way.&#x201d;<br><br>Technically we were all Crafters, witches with a unique set of abilities. My family happened to be Wishcrafters, who could grant wishes, but there were dozens and dozens of other witchy varieties that lived and worked among oblivious mortals here in the Enchanted Village. This charming neighborhood of Salem, Massachusetts, was a tourist hot spot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the place I now considered home.<br><br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Ve said, relenting with her quick response to the truth of the matter. &#x201c;How about a yoga studio?&#x201d;<br><br>Shooting her arms out to the sides for balance, she placed the sole of her right foot on her left inner knee, attempting, I presumed, the tree pose. Her arms windmilled wildly as she swayed to and fro. I resisted the strong urge to shout &#x201c;Timber!&#x201d; as I grabbed hold of her to keep her from tipping over.<br><br>Flicking me a wry look, she said, &#x201c;Maybe not yoga.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not,&#x201d; I agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll think of something.&#x201d; With a sweeping wave of her hand, she added, &#x201c;But first, this all needs to go.&#x201d;<br><br>By &#x201c;all,&#x201d; she meant the decades of flotsam that had been stashed and stored in the massive garage. Floor-to-ceiling stacks of boxes, bags, trunks. Christmas and Halloween decor. A tattered love seat and other assorted furniture, dust-covered bookshelves, and side tables. Simply sorting through everything could take weeks. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s best to wait until spring for a yard sale,&#x201d; I suggested.<br><br>By then this particular flight of fancy of hers might pass.<br><br>I hoped.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no.&#x201d; She strode over to a clothing rack stuffed with zipped dusty black garment bags. &#x201c;An impromptu yard sale is just what I need to take&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Abruptly, she bit off her words, and I swallowed over a sudden lump in my throat.<br><br><i>To take her mind off the fact that I was moving out.</i><br><br>I sent Harper a pleading look. She gave me a sympathetic nod and said, &#x201c;You know what could occupy your time, Aunt Ve? Helping me. Marcus&#x2019; parents arrive back in the village tomorrow morning, and we&#x2019;re supposed to have dinner with them tomorrow night.&#x201d; She pressed her hands together, pleading. &#x201c;Help me figure out how to get out of it. <i>Please.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>With a grateful smile I said, &#x201c;Tomorrow night? You mean you&#x2019;re not going to the auditions for the play?&#x201d;<br><br>One of my best friends, Evan Sullivan, was directing his first musical at the village playhouse, <i>The Sound of Music</i>. Evan was understandably nervous. Though he had a fondness for the theater, as half Bakecrafter his true gift was creating delectable miniature delights at the Gingerbread Shack, his boutique bakery. To bolster his confidence, he&#x2019;d recruited some friends to help with the production. As I couldn&#x2019;t sing or dance, I had been assigned to lead the scenery team. We&#x2019;d already had our introductory meeting, and tomorrow afternoon we would commence with building the sets at the large scene shop inside the playhouse. Afterward, I&#x2019;d agreed to help Evan with auditions.<br><br>He&#x2019;d bribed me with devil&#x2019;s food mini cupcakes.<br><br>He knew exactly how use my weaknesses to his advantage.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t sing,&#x201d; Harper said with a shudder. &#x201c;Or dance. Though if it gets me out of that dinner, maybe I should reconsider. It would be less humiliating. What time are the auditions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four to seven,&#x201d; I said, watching her carefully. After Harper had moved to this village and become the owner of the Spellbound bookshop more than a year ago, her confidence had grown by leaps and bounds. It was rare to see her nerves on full display.&nbsp;<br><br>Looking crestfallen, she said, &#x201c;That won&#x2019;t help. The dinner&#x2019;s at eight. Maybe I can come down with scurvy or something by then.&#x201d;<br><br>I laughed. &#x201c;Scurvy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take anything at this point. The Debrowskis don&#x2019;t like me as is, and you know how I get when I&#x2019;m nervous. I&#x2019;m bound to spill or break something.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to reassure her. &#x201c;They like you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, they don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Harper returned, perfectly calm and absolutely serious.<br><br>I picked up a plastic bin. Its label said only bedroom. Sheets and blankets, I figured. &#x201c;Of course they do.&#x201d;<br><br>Ve unzipped a garment bag. &#x201c;No, Harper&#x2019;s right. They don&#x2019;t. They don&#x2019;t like any of us.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d said that as though it was common knowledge. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re having a full-sized cow that Marcus fell for Harper in the first place.&#x201d;<br><br>Harper looked at me with a smug smile. &#x201c;Told you&nbsp;so.&#x201d;<br><br>She loved being right.<br><br>Still disbelieving, I stared at our aunt. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t they like us?&#x201d;<br><br>I knew the Debrowskis by sight, but I had never officially met Penelope and Oliver. They&#x2019;d retired from their law firm a few years ago, handing it over to Marcus to run once he graduated from law school. The pair traveled a lot, spending hardly any time at all here in the village. A few weeks here and there. I hadn&#x2019;t yet had occasion to run into them.<br><br>&#x201c;That Penelope has always been a jealous prune,&#x201d; Ve said, wrinkling her face to resemble the dried fruit. &#x201c;She fancies herself a free spirit and was always most annoyed that I could grant wishes while she had to practice law. Not that I blame her. I&#x2019;d be jealous, too. Law is so dreadful. She&#x2019;s a Crosser, you know. Half Colorcrafter, half Lawcrafter. Despite Color being her predominate Craft, her father threatened to cut her off if she didn&#x2019;t join the family law firm. She almost flunked out of law school but somehow managed to graduate.&#x201d;<br><br>Witches who had parents with differing Crafts inherited both abilities; however, one ability was definitely stronger than the other. We called these witches Cross-Crafters, or Crossers, for short.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, the free-spirit thing explains her love of �bohemian clothes,&#x201d; Harper said dryly.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let her bother you,&#x201d; Ve advised. &#x201c;Just focus on that man of yours and all will be well.&#x201d;<br><br>Color rushed into Harper&#x2019;s cheeks. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not <i>mine</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br>Ve met my gaze and we both burst out laughing.<br><br>Harper, who until she met Marcus had compared marriage to a prison sentence, shot us an annoyed look. She then picked up another box and carried it out to the driveway, stomping the whole way. She hated being wrong about anything. Especially about strong beliefs such as marriage and lifelong commitments.<br><br>Ve unzipped another garment bag and laughed as she pulled out the frilliest wedding gown I&#x2019;d ever seen. &#x201c;Well, lookie what we have here.&#x201d; She held it up to herself, nearly poking her eye with a wayward ruffle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the dress I wore to my wedding to Godfrey.&#x201d;<br><br>Cloakcrafter Godfrey Baleaux owned the Bewitching Boutique here in the village and had been the third of Ve&#x2019;s four husbands, the one she once referred to as a rat-toad bottom dweller. She didn&#x2019;t call him that anymore. Not often, anyway. I considered him family. An uncle of sorts, though he liked to claim he was my fairy godfather. He&#x2019;d rescued me from more than one fashion disaster.<br><br>&#x201c;Did Godfrey design that, Aunt Ve?&#x201d; Harper turned to me. &#x201c;Because if so, maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t let him be in charge of <i>your</i> wedding dress, Darcy.&#x201d;<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t imagine that dress was one of Godfrey&#x2019;s creations. He preferred classic, timeless fashion. That gown was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you getting ahead of yourself? I&#x2019;m not even engaged.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yet,&#x201d; Ve and Harper said in unison, both with big smiles.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t help smiling, too. Police Chief Nick Sawyer and I had been dating for more than a year, and a few months ago we&#x2019;d had the Talk. I knew a proposal was just a matter of time, and thanks to a slip of the tongue by his teenage daughter, Mimi, I knew he already had the ring. The anticipation of what he had planned&#x2014;and when&#x2014;was killing me. Part of me wondered if he was waiting to pop the big question at the housewarming&nbsp;party next weekend, but then I immediately ruled that out.<br><br>Nick was rather private. He wouldn&#x2019;t put such a special moment on full display in front of our family and friends. And I wouldn&#x2019;t want that, either. It should be just the two of us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>&#x201c;Honestly, I don&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s waiting for,&#x201d; Harper said. &#x201c;Do you want me to talk to him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Definitely not,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll ask when he asks.&#x201d;<br><br>Harper <i>harrumph</i>ed.<br><br>I grabbed a box and set it next to the others in the driveway, near a spot where my dog, Missy, lay stretched out in a puddle of sunshine. The mini schnoodle&#x2014;half mini poodle, half mini schnauzer&#x2014;watched us with sleepy eyes.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been extra tired lately, and I was starting to worry. I added making an appointment with the local vet to my to-do list. It probably wasn&#x2019;t necessary, but I didn&#x2019;t want to take any risks with her health.<br><br>Glancing at my watch, I noted that Nick was due here soon to help move these boxes. My new place had been recently renovated top to bottom, which included adding a new stacked-stone fireplace in the family room addition. I had high hopes that Nick would end up with me in front of that fireplace tonight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, this was all me, my design,&#x201d; Ve said, eyeing the dress with pity. &#x201c;The fact that Godfrey still married me despite this atrocity rather proves how smitten he had been with me. Perhaps I shouldn&#x2019;t have divorced him.&#x201d; She <i>tsk</i>ed.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you two hated each other by the end of the first year,&#x201d; Harper said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; she said thoughtfully. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t hate him now.&#x201d;<br><br>Aunt Ve had monogamy issues.<br><br>And loneliness issues.<br><br>With my moving out of her house, I had the feeling she was casting a wide net to replace my daily presence in her life.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget about Andreus,&#x201d; I reminded my aunt. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he coming back to the village this weekend? He&#x2019;ll have your days occupied in no time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And nights, too,&#x201d; Ve mused with a wiggle of her eyebrows.<br><br>Harper clapped a hand over her mouth and said through spread fingers, &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to be sick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You and me both,&#x201d; I added.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you two,&#x201d; Ve said with a laugh. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good man.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Mostly good.&#x201d; Another pause. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a man.&#x201d;<br><br>Charmcrafter Andreus Woodshall was the director of the Roving Stones, a traveling rock-and-mineral show that visited the village several times a year. Despite the fact that he was the scariest man I&#x2019;d ever met, he and Ve had hit it off the last time he&#x2019;d been here. Whether he was good or bad was one of those questions that had yet to be fully answered. From what I knew of him, it was a mixed bag. He was a complicated man.<br><br>Ve frowned. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;ll be leaving again soon enough. He has only a week off before traveling to a show in Florida.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Live in the moment, Aunt Ve.&#x201d; Harper sounded more cheerleaderish than I&#x2019;d ever imagined she could.<br><br>Lifting her chin, Ve smiled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, Harper. That&#x2019;s exactly what I should do.&#x201d; She moved aside a dusty bookcase and wiggled behind it. &#x201c;And the first order of business is to get this garage cleaned out for that big yard sale tomorr&#x2014; <i>Oh.</i> Oh dear. Oh my.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; I asked, watching her face lose all color.<br><br>&#x201c;What? Did you find the veil that went with that hideous wedding dress?&#x201d; Harper asked, chuckling. &#x201c;I can only imagine what <i>that</i> looked like.&#x201d;<br><br>One of Ve&#x2019;s hands flew up to cover her mouth as she stared at something deep in the recesses of the garage. &#x201c;No. No veil.&#x201d; Over her shoulder, she said in an unnatural high-pitched voice, &#x201c;Darcy dear, would you please give Nick a call?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Everything DASH Diet Cookbook: Lower your blood pressure and lose weight - with 300 quick and easy recipes!</h2><p><b>Take care of your heart&#x2014;and your waistline!</b><br><br>Studies show that the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, can help lower blood pressure in just fourteen days!

From Neolithic times through the earliest civilizations of the ancient Near East, in savannahs, river valleys and the terraces created by the Incas in the Andean mountains, an increasing range of agricultural techniques have developed in response to very different conditions. These developments are recounted in this book, with detailed attention to the ways in which plants, animals, soil, climate, and society have interacted.</p><p>Mazoyer and Roudart&#x2019;s <b>A History of World Agriculture</b> is a path-breaking and panoramic work, beginning with the emergence of agriculture after thousands of years in which human societies had depended on hunting and gathering, showing how agricultural techniques developed in the different regions of the world, and how this extraordinary wealth of knowledge, tradition and natural variety is endangered today by global capitialism, as it forces the unequal agrarian heritages of the world to conform to the norms of profit. </p><p>During the twentieth century, mechanization, motorization and specialization have brought to a halt the pattern of cultural and environmental responses that characterized the global history of agriculture until then. Today a small number of corporations have the capacity to impose the farming methods on the planet that they find most profitable. Mazoyer and Roudart propose an alternative global strategy that can safegaurd the economies of the poor countries, reinvigorate the global economy, and create a livable future for mankind. </p></p><p><p><b>Marcel Mazoyer</b> is professor of comparative agriculture and agricultural development at the National Institute of Agronomy (INA) in Paris, where he succeeded Rene Dumont.

Whitmont explores the major themes of illness, health, and the practice of medicine. Uniquely qualified by his personal associations with such pioneers as Carl Jung, M. Esther Harding, Karl Konig, Elizabeth Wright Hubbard, and G.B. Stearns, Whitmont takes a daring plunge into the paradoxes of homeopathic medicine, psychoanalytic transference, quantum physics, and the Gaia Hypothesis. Deftly exploring such subjects as Jungian synchronicity, alchemy, the I Ching, and the Law of Similars, he hints at the unknown principles fusing organism, planet, and cosmos and at a healing principle so profound it is written in both the stars and the sub-molecular traces of molecules.<br><br>In this landmark work that addresses for the first time in our century the esoteric role of the physician in the drama of life and death, Whimont provides a forum for one of the most neglected voices of Western Civilization&#x2014;that of disease&#x2014;revealing how it is our own abandoned and depreciated voice. In challenging the myth of mechanical medicine he provides a clue as to how we might yet heal ourselves and our planet.</p><p>Born in Vienna, Edward C. Whitmont received an M.D. degree from the University of Vienna in 1936. He has lived in the United States since 1938, maintaining a private practice in New York City in analytical psychology.

Hundley offers the reader not only insight into the political organization of the diverse Mongol realm, but also an eloquent discussion on the religious effects of Mongol policies as well as the role of women in dynastic interests. The usefulness of the text is manifold: it is helpful reference material for those who specialize in Asian Studies and the European Middle Ages and also teach world history with an emphasis on cultural interaction, and also serves a comprehensive introduction to the history of the Mongol Empire, accessible to general readership.&#34; - Sebastian P.

It offers New York-lovers and 1930s-buffs a look at life as it was lived in the days when a trolley ride cost only a few cents, a room at the Plaza was $7.50, Dodger fans flocked to Ebbetts Field, and the new World&#39;s Fair was the talk of the town. The New York of 1939 was a city where adventures began under the clock at the Biltmore, the big liners sailed at midnight, and Times Square was considered the crossroads of the world.</p><p>This and several similar guides were sanctioned by the Federal Writers Project in the 1930s.

A vow can be as "small" as the aspiration to smile at someone at least once every day, or as "big" as marriage; as personal as deciding to be mindful when picking up the phone or as universal as vowing to save all sentient beings. It can be deeply spiritual, utterly ordinary, or both. Zen teacher Jan Chozen Bays looks to traditional Buddhist teachings to show the power of vows&#x2014;and then applies that teaching broadly to the many vows we make. She shows that if we work with vows consciously, they set us in the direction of achieving our goals, both temporal and spiritual.<br><br>Bays presents secular and spiritual wisdom from both East and West, highlighting figures such as Martha Graham, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Buckminster Fuller. She helps us examine the vows we have already made for ourselves and the vows we&#x2019;ve unconsciously inherited. She supports us in repairing broken vows, crafting new intentions, and exploring what&#x2019;s truly on our bucket lists.</p><p>JAN CHOZEN BAYS, MD, is a Zen master in the White Plum lineage of the late master Taizan Maezumi Roshi. She serves as a priest and teacher at the Jizo Mountain-Great Vow Zen Monastery in Clatskanie, Oregon. She is also a pediatrician who specializes in the evaluation of children for abuse and neglect."A vow is a pledge or promise to bring direction and intention into our lives. Yet, how are we to discover the distinctive direction and purpose of our lives? How do we sort the trivial from the vital and essential? As a physician and Zen teacher&#x2014;a healer of both the body and soul&#x2014;Jan Bays offers deep insight for discovering the true gifts we want to bring to our unique life. This gem of a book awakens our capacity for vow-empowered living."&#x2014;Duane Elgin, author of <i>Voluntary Simplicity<br><br></i>&#x201c;Our intentions count for so much more than we usually think.

William Rodman Shankle and Daniel G. Amen reveal the latest research and treatment methods for preventing, delaying, and treating the devastation of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p><p>William Rodman Shankle, M.S., M.D., a neurologist with expertise in dementia, established the University of California, Irvine, Alzheimer's Disease Clinic in 1988 and served as its medical director for ten years.<br><p>Daniel G. Amen, M.D., is a clinical neuroscientist, a psychiatrist, and the director of clinics in California, Washington state, and Virginia. In addition to operating a private practice, he is an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine, College of Medicine. He is the author of <b>Healing ADD</b>, <b>Healing Anxiety and Depression</b>, and <b>Change Your Brain, Change Your Life</b>.</p>The concept of "prevention through delay" as presented by Shankle, a neurologist, and Amen, a psychiatrist, is a proactive approach to thwarting dementia. They break this process down into three components that involve knowing and reducing those risk factors you can control; having a regular memory screening to detect problems early; and obtaining an accurate, early diagnosis and treatment. The authors include their Shankle-Amen Early Dementia Detection Questionnaire as a screening tool to assess risk factors, and follow with discussions on ways to reduce risks and take steps for prevention. Useful tables abound, providing a synopsis of environmental, acquired and modifiable risks for dementia; as well as a review of effective prevention agents. The chapter devoted to finding the right diagnosis offers practical advice on how to get a thorough assessment and drives home the importance of this step by telling readers that 95% of persons with dementia are diagnosed by their primary care doctor four or more years after symptoms first appeared. The authors go on to offer an in-depth approach for patients to work with their doctor to make reversing memory loss "a reality." Although there is plenty of information on treating early dementia, much of it may be too technical for lay readers, and the accompanying photos (showing the brain before and after treatments) do little to elucidate treatment and prevention options. However, an excellent section on resources for caregivers and their families, as well as the aforementioned tables, are extremely helpful. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this searing nonfiction graphic novel, Box Brown sets his sights on this timely topic.</b></p><p>Mexico, 1519 CE. </p><p>During the Spanish conquests Cort�s introduced hemp farming as part of his violent colonial campaign. In secret, locals began cultivating the plant for consumption. It eventually made its way to the United States through the immigrant labor force where it was shared with black laborers. It doesn't take long for American lawmakers to decry cannabis as the vice of "inferior races."</p><p>Enter an era of propaganda designed to feed a moral panic about the dangers of a plant that had been used by humanity for thousands of years. Cannabis was given a schedule I classification, which it shared with drugs like heroin. This opened the door for a so-called &#x201c;war on drugs&#x201d; that disproportionately targeted young black men, leaving hundreds of thousands in prison, many for minor infractions. With its roots in "reefer madness" and misleading studies into the effects of cannabis, America&#x2019;s complicated and racialized relationship with marijuana continues to this day. </p><p>In <i>Cannabis</i>, Box Brown delves deep into this troubling history and offers a rich, entertaining, and thoroughly researched graphic essay on the legacy of cannabis legislation in America.</p></p><p><b>Box Brown</b> is an Ignatz Award-winning cartoonist, illustrator, and comic publisher from Philadelphia.

The book's overarching theme is marijuana's restriction by governing bodies based on overt racism or political agendas. The story includes examples from other countries but focuses on the fascinating and disturbing history of marijuana in the United States. Cannabis was always connected with black and brown people, so-called "inferior races" whose drug use supposedly drove them to insanity and violence, posing a threat to the safety of white America. Multiple studies over time could not prove negative effects, but those outcomes were either hidden or manipulated to support criminalization. The resulting overpolicing of communities of color (despite similar levels of usage in other communities) continues today. Activism during the AIDS crisis opened the door to medical use and, eventually, legal recreational use. The use of cannabis is still a controversial issue. Local laws conflict with more restrictive federal laws, and there is still a correlation vs. causation debate regarding its safety. However, this volume, backed up by an extensive bibliography, emphasizes the history, not the debate. The clear, spare art packs a lot of information into the book's uncluttered panels. The style effectively explores and illuminates the complex role of cannabis in U.S. society. VERDICT Although disagreement about cannabis remains, this well-researched book takes an unflinching look at how racism and political agendas have influenced perceptions and policy.

Christian Zionism is often seen as the offspring of premillennial dispensationalism. But the historical roots of Christian Zionism came long before the rise of the Plymouth Brethren and John Nelson Darby. In fact, the authors of <em>The New Christian Zionism</em> contend that the biblical and theological connections between covenant and land are nearly as close in the New Testament as in the Old. Written with academic rigor by experts in the field, this book proposes that Zionism can be defended historically, theologically, politically and morally. While this does not sanctify every policy and practice of the current Israeli government, the authors include recommendations for how twenty-first-century Christian theology should rethink its understanding of both ancient and contemporary Israel, the Bible and Christian theology more broadly. This provocative volume proposes a place for Christian Zionism in an integrated biblical vision.</p><p>Gerald R. McDermott (PhD, University of Iowa) is Anglican Chair of Divinity at Beeson Divinity School in Birmingham, Alabama. He is also associate pastor at Christ the King Anglican Church. His books include <em>The Theology of Jonathan Edwards</em> (with Michael McClymond), <em>God's Rivals</em> and <em>The Great Theologians</em>."In certain circles, the cause of Christian Zionism has acquired a bad odor. Some would-be sympathizers cringe at its history of dubious end-times speculation, while others want to avoid blessing the government and military policies of Israel. The theologians and historians included in this volume propose, as its titles suggests, a <em>new</em> Christian Zionism, grounded not in the belief that Israel is 'a perfect country' or 'the last Jewish state we will see before the end of days,' but in sound biblical theology and common-sense political wisdom." (Matt Reynolds, Christianity Today, September 2016)<br><br>"In this exciting and extraordinarily important work, Gerald McDermott and his contributors point us toward a fresh way of understanding the relationship between Christianity and Judaism&#x2015;one in which Israel is not regarded merely as a voice from the past or a transitional entity consigned to a passing dispensational role, but regarded instead as an essential and enduring presence at the heart of the church's ongoing life. In their view, the 'scandal of Zionism' is an instance of the 'scandal of particularity' at the very core of the gospel&#x2015;the paradox that the biblical God has conveyed a universal message by means of a particular people and a particular land whose particularity is never to be effaced or superseded. If they are right, the implications are enormous for Christians and Jews alike." (Wilfred M. McClay, G. T. and Libby Blankenship Chair in the History of Liberty, University of Oklahoma)<br><br>"This book is rigorous in its scholarship and speaks with thoughtfulness and passion about an understudied and widely misunderstood subject.

He simply can't wait for the next Can't Do book, called <i>What Grandmas Can't Do.</i>Wood's (Old Turtle) refreshing, spontaneous tale spotlights the rapport between a patient, apparently single father and his all-knowing child. The child narrator, like his dad a green dino in human clothing, shares his insights into the things "that regular people can do but dads can't." Perceptive kids will see that this father is both safety-conscious and one very good sportDand most well-loved kids will nod in recognition as they read how dads "can't cross the street without holding hands" and "can't pitch a baseball very hard or hit one very far." Cushman's (the Aunt Eater mysteries) equally wry watercolor and pen-and-ink art cagily picks up where the narrative leaves off: he illustrates the statement "Dads aren't good at sleeping late" with an image of the youngster pulling the covers off his father while the bedside clock reads 5:05; the father is shown purchasing a toy robot as his son accuses dads of having "trouble holding onto their money"; and at bedtime, the child fearfully pulls his blanket up to his eyes as he notes that dads "like to check under the bed for monsters." This tongue-in-cheek tale ends on a forgivably sugary note: "Most of all, whatever happens, a dad never stops loving you." Just the right blend of sassiness and sentiment. Ages 3-8.

This slim book starts with the<br>meeting of an English traveler and an enigmatic elderly Frenchwoman on an Aegean island. He is captivated by her painting of a busy Caribbean port in the shadow of a volcano, which leads her to tell him the story of her childhood in that town back at the beginning of the twentieth century. The tale she unfolds, set in the tropical luxury of the island of Saint-Jacques, is one of romantic intrigue and decadence involving the descendants of slaves and a fading French aristocracy. Then, on the night of the annual Mardi Gras ball, a whole world comes to a catastrophic and haunting end.</p><p><b>Patrick Leigh Fermor </b>(1915&#x2013;2011) was an intrepid traveler and a heroic soldier who is widely considered to be one of the finest travel writers of the twentieth century.

His books <i>A Time to Keep Silence</i> (1957), <i>Mani</i> (1958) and <i>Roumeli</i> (1966) attest to his deep interest in languages and remote places. In the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, and fought in Greece and Crete. He was awarded the DSO and OBE. Leigh Fermor lived partly in Greece&#x2014;in the house he designed with his wife, Joan, in an olive grove in the Mani&#x2014;and partly in Worcestershire. In 2004 he was knighted for his services to literature and to British&#x2013;Greek relations.

Everyone knew him. He was Bob the Railway Dog. Based on a real dog who rode the rails in the late nineteenth century, <i>Bob the Railway Dog </i>is a celebration of discovery and companionship for those who dream of the hustle and bustle of a life filled with adventure.</p><p><b>Corinne Fenton</b> is the author of numerous books for children, including <i>Queenie: One Elephant&#x2019;s Story, </i>illustrated by Peter Gouldthorpe. She lives in Sydney, Australia.<br><br><b>Andrew McLean</b> is a three-time winner of the Children&#x2019;s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Award. <i>Bob the Railway Dog </i>is his first book with Candlewick Press. He lives in Victoria, Australia.K-Gr 2&#x2014;It's 1884, and a group of homeless dogs are part of the cargo on a train at a station in South Australia. A guard named Will Ferry has an instant connection with one of the dogs and immediately adopts him, naming him Bob. The pup loves adventure and travels on different trains throughout Australia as the country's railroad system continues to grow during the late 1880s. Soon, he is dubbed Bob the Railway Dog and is known by railroad workers across the land. Bob takes time to visit his old friend Guard Ferry every once in a while. But whenever he hears the sound of the train whistle, he is ready to jump back on board for another adventure. Fenton's tale is a charming look at a small slice of history. A brief note about the real-life Bob, whose photo is still hanging at the Adelaide Station in Australia and whose collar is on display at Australia's National Railway Museum in Port Adelaide, is appended. McLean's detailed illustrations, which are done in watercolor, charcoal, and pencil, bring historical Australia to life, depicting both the vastness of the sprawling outback and also the growing railroad system and cities. Bob is depicted as shaggy and rugged, suitable for his bold personality and very similar to the photo Fenton includes in her author's note. VERDICT The engaging text and the intricacy of the pictures make this book ideal for solo or one-on-one reading.

When Paris Minton meets a beautiful new woman, before he knows it he has been beaten up, slept with, shot at, robbed, and his bookstore burned to the ground. He&#39;s in so much trouble he has no choice but to get his friend, Fearless Jones, out of jail to help him.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, June 2001:</b> Those of us who have been waiting for Walter Mosley to return to mystery writing--and there are many of us--have cause to rejoice. Not only has Mosley written a mystery, he is introducing a new character who could turn out to be as popular as Easy Rawlins.<p> Fearless Jones has a lot in common with Easy, but he also has some characteristics reminiscent of Socrates Fortlow, the "hero" of <i>Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned</i>. When the story begins, the reader is transported to the Los Angeles of the 1950s, a dangerous place and time for a black man. But Paris Minton seems to have beaten the odds. He owns a moderately successful and very satisfying business--a used book store. He spends the time he's not in the store scouring libraries for discarded books and selling them in just enough quantity to be independent and happy. Yes, he is visited on a regular basis by members of the LAPD who want him to prove to them that he did not steal the books, but that is a small price to pay for independence.</p><p> Minton's peaceful life is interrupted one day when a beautiful woman walks into his store and asks for the Reverend William Grove. In no time flat, Paris has been beaten into unconsciousness by a man following her and has been rewarded by the woman with sex. The lovely Elana Love is obviously trouble, but Paris jumps in feet first and, as a consequence, his store is burned to the ground. It is obviously time to call in Fearless Jones, a man well named. Jones is afraid of nothing, but there is a little matter to be taken care of before he can help. He's in jail and Paris must raise bail to get him out. Once he does that, the pair embark on a wild ride through Los Angeles on behalf of Elana Love. As always, Mosley depicts the hard-boiled L.A. in a powerful and distinctive way, and we can only hope that this is the first of a series. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Walter Mosley is the author of the acclaimed Easy Rawlins series, Blue Light and RL&#39;s Dream, and two collections of stories featuring Socrates Fortlow, Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned, for which he received the Anisfield-Wold Award, and Walkin&#39; the Dog. He was born in Los Angeles and lives in New York.</p><h2>The Hundred Wells of Salaga: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>Based on true events, a story of courage, forgiveness, love, and freedom in precolonial Ghana, told through the eyes of two women born to vastly different fates. </b></b><br><br>Aminah lives an idyllic life until she is brutally separated from her home and forced on a journey that transforms her from a daydreamer into a resilient woman.

Johnston </b>is recognized as a master of the American historical novel. His grand adventures of the American West combine the grace and beauty of a natural storyteller with complete dedication to historical accuracy and authenticity. Johnston was born on the first day of 1947 on the plains of Kansas, and lived all his life in the American West. His first novel, <i>Carry the Wind,</i> won the Medicine Pipe Bearer Award from the Western Writers of America, and his subsequent books have appeared on bestseller lists throughout the country. After writing more than thirty novels, he died in March 2001 in Millings, Montana.1<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Just like the bone-numbing scream of the enemy, the wind tormented those branches of the towering spruce overhead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Titus Bass jolted awake, coming up even before his eyes were open.<br> &nbsp;<br> He sat there, sweaty palm clutching his rifle, heart thundering in his ears so loudly that it drowned out near everything but that next faint, thready scream emanating from somewhere above.<br> &nbsp;<br> The frightening cry faded into no more than a gentle sough as the gust of wind wound its way on down the canyon, sailing past their camp, farther still into the river valley fed by the numberless streams and creeks they were trapping that spring.<br> &nbsp;<br> As his breathing slowed, Titus swiped the dew of sweat from his face with a broad hand&#x2014;remembering where he was. Remembering why he was here. Then peered around at the other dark forms sprawled on the ground, all of them radiating from the ember heap of last night&#x2019;s fire like the hardwood spokes on a wagon wheel. Downright eerie, quiet as death itself were those eight other men. Not one of them snoring, sputtering, or talking in his sleep. Almost as if the eight shapeless cocoons of buffalo robes and thick wool blankets weren&#x2019;t alive at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only he&#x2014;finding himself suddenly alone in this suddenly still wilderness. Alone with this clap of dark gathered here beneath the utter black of sky just beyond the tops of the tall pines. Alone with the remembrance of those cries and screams and death-calls from the Blackfoot warriors as the enemy charged forward, scrambling up the boulders toward the handful of American trappers who had taken refuge there in the rocks, preparing to sell their no-account lives just as dearly as any men ever would dare in that high and terrible country where the most hated band of red-skinned thieves and brigands roamed, and plundered, and murdered.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been that way for far longer than he had been in the mountains. And sitting right then and there in the dark, Titus Bass had no reason to doubt that the Blackfoot would still be raiding and killing long after his own bones were bleaching beneath the sun that rose every morning to burn away the mists tucked back in every wrinkle in the cloud-tall Rocky Mountains.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rising in a slow crescendo, the cry began again above him, like a long fingernail dragged up a man&#x2019;s spine. Looking up against the tarry darkness of that sky pricked only with tiny, cold dots of light, he watched the blacker branches sway and bob with the growing insistence of the wind, blotting out the stars here and there as they weaved back and forth. Groaning, whining&#x2014;those branches tossed against one another, rubbing and creaking with the frightening cry that had brought him suddenly awake.<br> &nbsp;<br> With the next swirling gust of breeze, Titus discovered he was damp, sweating beneath the robe and thick woolen blanket. After kicking both off his legs he sat listening to that noisy rustle of wind as it muscled its way through the tops of the trees overhead and hurtled on down into the valley, descending from the slopes of that granite and scree and bone-colored talus above their camp. A wind given its birth far higher in the places where the snow never departed, above him across that barren ground where even trees failed to grow. Those high and terrible places where if a man had the grit or were fool enough, he could climb and climb and climb until he reached the very top of the tallest gray spire, there to stand and talk eye to eye with whatever fearsome god ruled from on high.<br> &nbsp;<br> Such a feat was for other men. Not the likes of Titus Bass. The spooky nearness of that god and the sky he ruled was close enough from right here. It had been ever since he had first come to these mountains, running from all that was, racing headlong to seize all that could be.<br> &nbsp;<br> This coming summer it would be three years since he first laid eyes on that jagged purple rip stretched across the far horizon&#x2014;three years since Titus Bass had journeyed eagerly into these high places. That would make this ... spring of twenty-eight.<br> &nbsp;<br> In many ways, that was a lifetime spent out here already.<br> &nbsp;<br> Twice now he had been spared. First with those Arapaho who&#x2019;d hacked off his topknot and left him for dead. Had it not been for the young mule carrying him out of enemy country, Bass was certain his bones would be bleaching beneath the sun of uncounted days yet to come. Then a second time&#x2014;only a matter of weeks ago&#x2014;that Blackfoot raiding party had tightened their red noose around a last-stand where Titus and the others had prepared to sell their lives dearly. Nine men who saw no real chance of coming out on the winning side of the bad hand dealt them.<br> &nbsp;<br> There in the dark now, Titus wondered just how many times a man might be given another chance, another go at his life. How often could a reasonable person expect to have the odds tipped in his favor? Once? Maybe. Twice? If a man were near that lucky, then Bass figured he might well be inching closer to that day when his luck had just plain run out ... gone like the tiny grains of sand that slipped through the narrow neck of an hourglass, one by one by one in a tumble of seemingly insignificant moments lost to the ebb of time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The days of a man&#x2019;s life eventually reaching the end of his ledger. Come the call for him to pay the fiddler.<br> &nbsp;<br> As he turned to glance at the heap of ash in the fire pit, Bass heard one of the animals snuffle out there in the darkness. He strained his eyes to peer into the inky gloom. After listening intently, he finally stared at the faint, glowing embers&#x2014;wondering if he should throw some more wood on, or just curl down within his bedding and try falling back to sleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> Absently digging at an itch nagging the back of his neck, he decided he would forget the fire. This was high season for ticks, tiny troublesome creatures who only weeks ago had killed one of the men already with the fever they carried. But his fingers reassured him that this itch was no tick, not even the lice he had played host to when he had first reached these Shining Mountains&#x2014;digging so often and voraciously at his hide that the trio who happened upon Titus came to call him Scratch.<br> &nbsp;<br> The name stuck, through all the seasons. With the coming and going of all those faces. Scratch&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> Another snuffle from the horses.<br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;re restless with the wind, he thought, shoving the blanket down off his legs and reaching for his moccasins. Horse be the kind of critter gets itself spooked easy enough in the wind, unable to smell danger. What with all this night moving around them, rustling&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> One of them snorted loudly, in just that way the Shoshone cayuses did when all was not well.<br> &nbsp;<br> He rose without knotting the moccasins around his ankles and snatched the pistol from beneath the wool blanket capote he had rolled for a pillow, then swept up the long, full-stocked flintlock rifle he curled up with between his legs every night. After that deadly battle with the Blackfeet, Scratch had even given the weapon its own name, calling it Ol&#x2019; Make-&#x2019;Em-Come.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the other men stirred, mumbling as he turned over within his blankets, and fell quiet again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bass stepped from the ring of bodies, around the far side of their camp rather than heading directly for that patch of ground where they had driven their animals and confined them within a rope corral before turning in for the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Better for a man to count ribs than to count tracks,&#x201d; explained Jack Hatcher.<br> &nbsp;<br> Far more preferable that a careful man&#x2019;s animals should go without the finest grazing possible than to discover those animals were run off by skulking brownskins. Putting a feller afoot in a hostile wilderness. Forced to cache most all his plunder, then follow those horses&#x2019; tracks with only what a man could carry on his own back.<br> &nbsp;<br> Was that hiss more of the wind soughing through the trees up ahead? Or ... could it have been a whisper?<br> &nbsp;<br> In the darkness, and this cold, Scratch knew a man&#x2019;s ears might well play tricks on him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scratch stopped, held his breath, listened.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind him in camp he thought he heard one of them stir, throwing back his bedding, muttering now in a low voice that alerted the others. They were coming out of their deep sleep as quiet as men in a dangerous land could.<br> &nbsp;<br> From beyond the trees the wind&#x2019;s whisper grew insistent now. Then a second whisper&#x2014;and the gorge suddenly rose in Bass&#x2019;s throat. Whoever was out there realized the camp was awakening. He brought up the long rifle and stepped into the gloom between the tall trees, cautiously.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a shriek the uneasy quiet was instantly shattered. A boom rocked the trees around him, the dark grove streaked with a muzzle flash.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bastards had guns!<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Columbia Restaurant: Celebrating a Century of History, Culture, and Cuisine (Florida History and Culture)</h2><p><p>The Columbia is Florida's oldest and most honored restaurant.

In this fascinating account, the impassioned Henry Hobhouse explains the consequences of these plants with attention-grabbing historical moments. While most records of history focus on human influence, Hobhouse emphasizes how plants too are a central and influential factor in the historical process. <i>Seeds of Change</i> is a captivating and invaluable addition to our understanding of modern culture.</p><p>Five plants--quinine, sugar cane, tea, cotton, and potato--have been powerful political historical catalysts, argues this speculative journalist. "Wise and witty . . . deserves to become a classic."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i>Henry Hobhouse has served on various academic, scholastic and local government bodies.

In 188 recipes, <strong>The Arab Table</strong> introduces home cooks to the fresh foods, exquisite tastes, and generous spirit of the Arab table.</p><p>May S. Bsisu, who has lived and cooked in Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait, England, and now the United States, takes you along a reassuringly down-to-earth and warmly personal path through exciting culinary territory. <strong>The Arab Table</strong> focuses intimately on the foods of Arab countries such as Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria.</p><p>The book offers a bountiful range of appealing dishes: cold and hot mezza, or little dishes; vibrant salads and fresh vegetable preparations; savory soups, stews, and hearty casseroles; baked and grilled meats, poultry, and fish; cooling drinks; and ambrosial desserts. There are recipes for familiar dishes including Falafel, Chicken and Lamb Kebabs, and Baklava, as well as a diverse selection of lesser known delights greatly enjoyed around the world, such as Eggplant Pomegranate Salad, Zucchini with Bread and Mint, Grilled Halloumi Cheese Triangles, and Arab Flatbread. Celebration dishes, the cornerstone of Arab cuisine, include Moroccan and Lebanese Couscous, Baked Lamb with Rice and Chickpeas, and Baked Sea Bass with Rice and Caramelized Onions. No Arab cookbook would be complete without an ample selection of soups and stews, the customary way to break the fast at the end of each day during Ramadan. The Arab table is also well known for its sweets: Semolina Pistachio Layer Cake, Milk Pudding, and, of course, date-, nut-, and cream-filled pastries perfumed with rose and orange-blossom water are just a sampling of the desserts included here.</p><p>Along with these treasured recipes collected from May's extended family, friends, neighbors, and her own discoveries, <strong>The Arab Table</strong> is also a resource for learning about the traditions and customs associated with this time-honored cuisine. Throughout, essays on Arab holidays, from Eid Al Adha, the feast celebrating the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca, to Ramadan and Mubarakeh, the celebration for the birth of a baby, are explained and menus are provided for each. May enlightens readers as to customary greetings (How do you say Happy Ramadan?), gifts (What do you bring to an Arab home during Ramadan?), and wishes (How do you acknowledge the birth of a baby?) that are traditionally extended during these special occasions.</p><p>Now you can bring the abundance and flavors of <strong>The Arab Table</strong> to your table.</p></p><p><p>May Shakhashir Bsisu is a resident of Cincinnati, Ohio. May has lived, eaten, and cooked in many parts of the world; however, paramount in her cooking, writing, and teaching is the authentic "old country" food of her Palestinian heritage. Today, both as a culinary professional and as an Arab-American woman, she has dedicated herself to preserving and teaching this healthful and delicious cuisine in the United States. She is a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals, Women Chefs &amp; Restaurateurs, and Chefs Collaborative.</p>Bsisu, an Ohio chef by way of Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait and England, sets out to define the cuisine of the Arab world. As she points out, a quarter of the globe is covered in her treatise, and she lovingly explores and clearly explains dishes from Morocco, Tunisia, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Yemen and the Arabian Gulf. What's most apparent is that Arab meals are elemental in nature, more often reliant upon foodstuffs than technique. There are perhaps a dozen key ingredients on which most of these 160 recipes are based. Bulgur (cracked wheat) gives rice a run for its money as the grain of choice and is integral in making Kibeh, an all-purpose dish that also employs beef or lamb, and a mix of spices, and can be made into skewers, balls or cooked in a baking dish. Yogurt is ubiquitous, and pomegranate finds its way into many courses, too, including Meatball Stew, and Saut�ed Chicken Gizzards. There are also plenty of classics at hand, including a couple of different couscouses, Grape Leaves Stuffed with Lamb and Rice, and Chicken Shawarma. American home cooks will find this a family-style, down-to-earth, insider exploration of Arab cuisine and culture.

The Radical Enlightenment played a part in this revolutionary process, which effectively overthrew all justification for monarchy, aristocracy, and ecclesiastical power, as well as man's dominance over woman, theological dominance of education, and slavery. Despite the present day interest in the revolutions of the eighteenth century, the origins and rise of the Radical Enlightenment have received limited scholarly attention. The greatest obstacle to the movement finding its proper place in modern historical writing is its international scope: the Racial Enlightenment was not French, British, German, Italian, Jewish or Dutch, but all of these at the same time.<br> In this wide-ranging volume, Jonathan Israel offers a novel interpretation of the Radical Enlightenment down to La Mettie and Diderot, two of its key exponents. Particular emphasis is placed on the pivotal role of Spinoza and the widespread underground international philosophical movement known before 1750 as Spinozism.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Israel</strong> is a professor in the School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.<br><br>"His vast--and vastly impressive--book sets out to redefine the intellectual landscape of early modern Europe....Magnificent and magisterial, <em>Radical Enlightenment</em> will undoubtedly be one of the truly great historical works of the decade."--John Adamson, <em>Sunday Telegraph</em><p></p><br>"[A] magnificent...study of the impact of Spinoza and his philosophy on European cultural history at the hinge of the 17th and 18th centuries....Sumptuous in the energy, clarity and breadth of its scholarship."--<em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Mr. Israel's lucid, engrossing account of the Enlightenment's formative period explains why we want our intellectual histories rewritten for every generation, for this Enlightenment overflows with our favorite things."--<em>The Scriblerian</em><p></p><br>"Israel's <em>Radical Enlightenment</em> is an audacious, pathbreaking, and deeply learned work that may be read on a multiplicity of levels. For the specialist, it is a thick empirical survey and analysis of a vast strain of thought derived from the work of Benedict de Spinoza."--<em>Journal of</em> <em>Interdisciplinary History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Performance Measurement: Getting Results (Urban Institute Press)</h2><p>Long before reinventing government came into vogue, the Urban Institute pioneered methods for government and human services agencies to measure the performance of their programs. This comprehensive guidebook synthesizes more than two decades of Harry Hatry's groundbreaking work. It covers every component of the performance measurement process, from identifying the program&#x2019;s mission, objectives, customers, and trackable outcomes to finding the best indicators for each outcome, the sources of data, and how to collect them. Hatry explains how to select indicator breakouts and benchmarks for comparison to actual values, and describes numerous uses for performance information. Since the publication of the first edition in 1999, the use of performance measurement has exploded at all levels of U.S. government, in nonprofit agencies, and around the world. The new edition has been revised and expanded to address recent developments in the field, including the increased availability of computer technology in collecting and presenting information, the movement to use outcome data to improve services, and the quality control issues that have emerged as data collection has increased. It is an indispensable handbook for newcomers and an important resource for experienced managers looking to improve their use of outcome data.</p><p>Harry Hatry is a principal research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., where he is the director of the Institute&#39;s Public Management Program. Since the early 1970s, he has been a leader in developing procedures that allow nonprofit organizations and federal, state, and local government agencies to track how well they are performing their services. In recent years, he has also worked to improve performance measurement and management in other countries. He has authored or co-authored numerous books, reports, and articles describing performance measurement procedures, including publications for the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice, the International City Management Association, and United Way of America. He has received awards relating to his work in performance measurement and evaluation from a number of organizations, including the American Society for Public Administration and the National Academy of Public Administration.Harry Hatry's new book is, quite simply, a must-read for anyone working to measure performance &#x2015; novices and old hands alike. Filled with examples, checklists, and suggestions, it explains every step in the process in a readable, practical style. I recommend it highly. &#x2015; Michael Hendricks, Independent Consultant<br><br>Hatry shares his encyclopedic knowledge of performance measurement in this complete and thoughtful volume. Agencies at the federal, state, and local level will find a wealth of information here. &#x2015; Michael W. Lawson, Director, ICMA Center for Performance Measurement<br><br>Why do we need performance measurement in public programs? Because without it, no reform works well. Performance measurement is inextricably linked to every major theme in public administration today, from citizen empowerment to managing for results and community building. Those of us who have been pursuing performance measurement for a long time recognize Harry Hatry as the master of the craft. His new book, Performance Measurement: Getting Results, is welcome indeed, for it fills a void in today's literature. For the practitioner, it is a handbook for implementing performance measurement, and for the academic, it is the first comprehensive textbook in this important area of public administration. It is also written in Mr. Hatry's well-recognized style: well-organized, no glitz, just nitty-gritty practical advice about what works and what doesn't. &#x2015; Mark Funkhouser, City Auditor, Kansas City, Missouri</p><h2>CliffsQuickReview French I</h2><p>CliffsQuickReview course guides cover the essentials of your toughest classes.

Even so, theoretical and mathematical concepts are introduced and developed sufficiently to make the book a self-contained source of instruction for readers without prior knowledge of the basic principles of the field. The work is the product of the technical staff of The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC), an organization whose success has resulted largely from its applications of optimal estimation techniques to a wide variety of real situations involving large-scale systems. </p><p>Arthur Gelb writes in the Foreword that "It is our intent throughout to provide a simple and interesting picture of the central issues underlying modern estimation theory and practice. Heuristic, rather than theoretically elegant, arguments are used extensively, with emphasis on physical insights and key questions of practical importance." </p><p>Numerous illustrative examples, many based on actual applications, have been interspersed throughout the text to lead the student to a concrete understanding of the theoretical material. The inclusion of problems with "built-in" answers at the end of each of the nine chapters further enhances the self-study potential of the text. </p><p>After a brief historical prelude, the book introduces the mathematics underlying random process theory and state-space characterization of linear dynamic systems. The theory and practice of optimal estimation is them presented, including filtering, smoothing, and prediction. Both linear and non-linear systems, and continuous- and discrete-time cases, are covered in considerable detail. New results are described concerning the application of covariance analysis to non-linear systems and the connection between observers and optimal estimators. The final chapters treat such practical and often pivotal issues as suboptimal structure, and computer loading considerations. </p><p>This book is an outgrowth of a course given by TASC at a number of US Government facilities. Virtually all of the members of the TASC technical staff have, at one time and in one way or another, contributed to the material contained in the work.</p></p><p></p><h2>Traveling with Sugar</h2><p><i>Traveling with Sugar</i> reframes the rising diabetes epidemic as part of a five-hundred-year-old global history of sweetness and power.

Most animal rights theory focuses on the intrinsic capacities or interests of animals, and the moral status and moral rights that these intrinsic characteristics give rise to. Zoopolis shifts the debate from the realm of moral theory and applied ethics to the realm of political theory, focusing on the relational obligations that arise from the varied ways that animals relate to human societies and institutions. Building on recent developments in the political theory of group-differentiated citizenship, <em>Zoopolis</em> <em></em>introduces us to the genuine "political animal". It argues that different types of animals stand in different relationships to human political communities. Domesticated animals should be seen as full members of human-animal mixed communities, participating in the cooperative project of shared citizenship. Wilderness animals, by contrast, form their own sovereign communities entitled to protection against colonization, invasion, domination and other threats to self-determination. "Liminal" animals who are wild but live in the midst of human settlement (such as crows or raccoons) should be seen as "denizens", resident of our societies, but not fully included in rights and responsibilities of citizenship. To all of these animals we owe respect for their basic inviolable rights. But we inevitably and appropriately have very different relations with them, with different types of obligations. Humans and animals are inextricably bound in a complex web of relationships, and Zoopolis offers an original and profoundly affirmative vision of how to ground this complex web of relations on principles of justice and compassion.<br></p><p><br>Sue Donaldson lives in Kingston, Canada where she writes essays, plays, and books, including a vegan recipe collection (<em>Foods That Don't Bite Back</em>, Arsenal Pulp Press 2003) and a mystery novel for young adults (<em>Thread of Deceit</em>, Sumach Press 2004).<br><br>Will Kymlicka is the author of six books published by Oxford University Press, including <em>Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction</em> (1990; second edition 2002), <em>Multicultural Citizenship</em> (1995), and <em>Multicultural Odysseys</em> (2007).

Modern democracy began in Europe, but for hundreds of years it competed with various forms of dictatorship. Now, though, the entire continent was in the democratic camp for the first time in history. But within a decade, this story had already begun to unravel. Some of the continent's newer democracies slid back towards dictatorship, while citizens in many of its older democracies began questioning democracy's functioning and even its legitimacy. And of course it is not merely in Europe where democracy is under siege. Across the globe the immense optimism accompanying the post-Cold War democratic wave has been replaced by pessimism. Many new democracies in Latin America, Africa, and Asia began "backsliding," while the Arab Spring quickly turned into the Arab winter. The victory of Donald Trump led many to wonder if it represented a threat to the future of liberal democracy in the United States. Indeed, it is increasingly common today for leaders, intellectuals, commentators and others to claim that rather than democracy, some form dictatorship or illiberal democracy is the wave of the future.<br><br>In <em>Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe</em>, Sheri Berman traces the long history of democracy in its cradle, Europe. She explains that in fact, just about every democratic wave in Europe initially failed, either collapsing in upon itself or succumbing to the forces of reaction. Yet even when democratic waves failed, there were always some achievements that lasted. Even the most virulently reactionary regimes could not suppress every element of democratic progress. Panoramic in scope, Berman takes readers through two centuries of turmoil: revolution, fascism, civil war, and - -finally -- the emergence of liberal democratic Europe in the postwar era. A magisterial retelling of modern European political history, <em>Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe</em> not explains how democracy actually develops, but how we should interpret the current wave of illiberalism sweeping Europe and the rest of the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sheri Berman</strong> is Professor of Political Science at Barnard College, Columbia University. She has written extensively on democracy, authoritarianism, populism, fascism, the history of the left, and European politics for both scholarly and non-scholarly publications.<br><br>"A dense, astute history and warning about the importance-in the face of growing illiberalism and the reawakening of authoritarianism-of continuing to strengthen democratic institutions and structures." -- <em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Sheri Berman has written a comprehensive and incisive -- I would even say indispensable -- guide to the historical conditions under which democracies rise and persist. <em>Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe</em> is a model for the kind of scholarship we urgently need today: erudite and analytically exact, it stands in continual dialogue with the most pressing political question of our time. And just in case that weren't enough, it will not only leave readers better equipped to understand the current moment, but also more optimistic that we may yet be able to shape a better future." -- <strong>Yascha Mounk</strong>, author of <em>The People vs. Democracy</em>; Lecturer on Government, Harvard University; and Senior Fellow, New America<p></p><br>"Sheri Berman's <em>Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe</em> is a magisterial survey of the ebb and flow of democratic tides over centuries of European politics. In her able hands, democracy's history counters the myopia of the present and offers hope for the future. Because past democratizers were able to overcome seemingly fatal setbacks, there is no compelling reason to assume that today's democratic recession will continue indefinitely." -- <strong>William A. Galston</strong>, Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution<p></p><br>"Sheri Berman brings history back into our anguished debate about the future of liberal democracy. A sweeping and authoritative review of political development in Europe and America since the 17th century, her work restores perspective and context to contemporary debates about democracy today." -- Michael Ignatieff, President, Central European University, Budapest<p></p><br>"<em>Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe</em> provides a lucid account of the way that European countries moved towards, and then away from democracy. Sheri Berman is one of the best comparativists going, providing an encompassing framework for understanding the historical development of modern institutions." -- Francis Fukuyama, author of <em>Identity</em> and Director of the Stanford Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law<p></p><br>"Berman shows that the story of democracy in Europe is complicated. A step forward is often followed by a step back. This may seem a bit obvious to anyone familiar with the broad outlines of European history, but Berman makes the case clearly and convincingly. Moreover, at a moment when hyperventilating over the decline of democracy has grown into a veritable intellectual industry, her long-view approach comes across as appealingly sober." - The New York Times<p></p><br>"Readers will come away from Berman's account with useful insights on the vital question of why democracy sometimes succeeds but often does not." - Foreign Affairs<p></p><br></p><h2>A Course in Game Theory (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><i>A Course in Game Theory</i> presents the main ideas of game theory at a level suitable for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, emphasizing the theory's foundations and interpretations of its basic concepts.

Parfit develops further his influential treatment of reasons, normativity, the meaning of moral discourse, and the status of morality. He engages with his critics, and shows the way to resolution of their differences.<br><br>This volume is partly about what it is for things to matter, in the sense that we all have reasons to care about these things. Much of the book discusses three of the main kinds of meta-ethical theory: Normative Naturalism, Quasi-Realist Expressivism, and Non-Metaphysical Non-Naturalism, which Derek Parfit now calls Non-Realist Cognitivism. This third theory claims that, if we use the word 'reality' in an ontologically weighty sense, irreducibly normative truths have no mysterious or incredible ontological implications. If instead we use 'reality' in a wide sense, according to which all truths are truths about reality, this theory claims that some non-empirically discoverable truths-such as logical, mathematical, modal, and some normative truths-raise no difficult ontological questions. <br><br>Parfit discusses these theories partly by commenting on the views of some of the contributors to Peter Singer's collection <em>Does Anything Really Matter? Parfit on Objectivity</em>. Though Peter Railton is a Naturalist, he has widened his view by accepting some further claims, and he has suggested that this wider version of Naturalism could be combined with Non-Realist Cognitivism. Parfit argues that Railton is right, since these theories no longer deeply disagree. Though Allan Gibbard is a Quasi-Realist Expressivist, he has suggested that the best version of his view could be combined with Non-Realist Cognitivism. Parfit argues that Gibbard is right, since Gibbard and he now accept the other's main meta-ethical claim. It is rare for three such different philosophical theories to be able to be widened in ways that resolve their deepest disagreements. This happy convergence supports the view that these meta-ethical theories are true. Parfit also discusses the views of several other philosophers, and some other meta-ethical and normative questions.<br></p><p><br>Derek Parfit, <em>All Souls, University of Oxford</em><br><br>Derek Parfit is one of the leading philosophers of our time.

The third edition features new material throughout, including discussions of the 2016 election and current political climate, the geography of poverty, the weakening of the safety net, the declining quality of employment opportunities, and more.<br><br>Many Americans believe that people are poor because of individual failings, such as lack of skills or work ethic. Poverty and Power challenges this view, showing that American poverty instead is a structural problem, resulting from failings of our political, economic, cultural, and social systems. The book examines the social forces and institutional problems that contribute to growing inequality and the persistence of poverty in the United States. Throughout the book, the author compares individualistic and structural approaches and makes a case for the superiority of a structural perspective on American poverty.</p><p>Edward Royce is professor emeritus of sociology at Rollins College where he was a recipient of the Cornell Distinguished Faculty Award. He is the author of The Origins of Southern Sharecropping and Classical Social Theory and Modern Society.Clear, accessible, and powerfully argued, Poverty and Power offers readers a deeply informed exploration of how we tend to explain poverty in the United States and how those dominant explanations differ from what we know about the reality of being poor in America. There may be no better single-volume introduction to the issue than this compelling and comprehensive book. (Stephen Pimpare, Casey School of Public Policy, University of New Hampshire)<br><br>At a time when America is facing a crisis of inequality and rising poverty, Edward Royce's Poverty and Power is a critical guide to understanding the true causes of economic hardship in our country and to avoiding falling for the false and misleading ideas about poverty that are so popular in the mass media. Poverty is a problem created by political power&#x2014;Royce shows how it's done, and how it can be undone. (Gordon Lafer, Professor, University of Oregon)</p><h2>African Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean</h2><p>This is an original survey of the economic and social history of slavery of the Afro-American experience in Latin America and the Caribbean. The focus of the book is on the Portuguese, Spanish, and French-speaking regions of continental America and the Caribbean. It analyzes the latest research on urban and rural slavery and on the African and Afro-American experience under these regimes. It approaches these themes both historically and structurally. The historical section provides a detailed analysis of the evolution of slavery and forced labor systems in Europe, Africa, and America. The second half of the book looks at the type of life and culture which the salves experienced in these American regimes.<br><br>The first part of the book describes the growth of the plantation and mining economies that absorbed African slave labor, how that labor was used, and how the changing international economic conditions affected the local use and distribution of the slave labor force. Particular emphasis is given to the evolution of the sugar plantation economy, which was the single largest user of African slave labor and which was established in almost all of the Latin American colonies.<br><br>Once establishing the economic context in which slave labor was applied, the book shifts focus to the Africans and Afro-Americans themselves as they passed through this slave regime. The first part deals with the demographic history of the slaves, including their experience in the Atlantic slave trade and their expectations of life in the New World. The next part deals with the attempts of the African and American born slaves to create a viable and autonomous culture. This includes their adaptation of European languages, religions, and even kinship systems to their own needs. It also examines systems of cooptation and accommodation to the slave regime, as well as the type and intensity of slave resistances and rebellions.<br><br>A separate chapter is devoted to the important and different role of the free colored under slavery in the various colonies. The unique importance of the Brazilian free labor class is stressed, just as is the very unusual mobility experienced by the free colored in the French West Indies.<br><br>The final chapter deals with the differing history of total emancipation and how ex-slaves adjusted to free conditions in the post-abolition periods of their respective societies. The patterns of post-emancipation integration are studied along with the questions of the relative success of the ex-slaves in obtaining control over land and escape from the old plantation regimes.<br></p><p><br><strong>Herbert S.

An active member of The Embroiderer&#39;s Guild of America, she regularly teaches felt wool appliqu� at guilds, events, and festivals across the United States. Deborah lives in Pennsylvania. deborahtirico.comStitching with felted wool is most commonly associated with penny rugs, an American folk craft used to make use of worn-out clothing and military uniforms. But there's more to felted wool appliqu� than folk art, as needle artist Tirico demonstrates in this collection of colorful projects. The introduction provides a concise overview of the basics, along with a brief exploration of the difference between appliqu� with felted wool and appliqu� with quilting cotton. The nature of felted wool makes it ideal for dimensional work&#x2015;as the wool is layered, stitched, and embellished, its thickness gives it depth. Felted wool is also a forgiving fabric for appliqu�, and beginners may find it slightly less fussy than working with quilting cotton. Standout projects include a Jacobean-style pillow cover featuring traditional motifs of the era, a nutcracker penny rug ideal for the Christmas table, and a small set of sewing accessories featuring a pincushion, metal box (cleverly constructed from a mint tin), and a scissor sheath and fob. VERDICT Tirico's colorful projects will appeal to stitchers with an interest in exploring traditional appliqu� motifs and techniques in felted wool.

The serialization of Rurouni Kenshin started in 1994 and concluded in 1999. His hobbies are to draw, read, play video games, read American comic books, and make model figures.A new direction begins for this enormously popular series as its protagonist, a wandering samurai, heads to Kyoto to prevent an assassination. Kenshin doesn't even appear in the first half of the book; instead, those who cared for him and called him friend react to his departure. The fighters respond to his perceived abandonment with rage, while in an affecting chapter, the women compare their hurts in an effort to determine who cares for him more. It's refreshing to see Watsuki's talent grow as he further defines the title character through the passion of the supporting cast. The distinctive character designs nicely complement the story's action, humor and drama, and the bold type fits the approach and makes the story easy to read. The battles are convenient standbys, symbolizing the deep emotions held by the various participants. Later in the book, Kenshin reappears to encounter a new character, a spunky young thief. She has his fighting talent and determination, but she's pledged to the other side in a situation fraught with conflict. As always with this series, the question of honor and duty is lightened through humor and the cast's zest for life. It's easy to see why this is such a well-liked book, especially for those seeking the excitement of adventure comics presented with a fresh approach. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"Except, I couldn&#x2019;t find just the right one. There were lots of books that were beautiful and interesting and would have been amazing, except they were all missing some element that I desperately desired. -- I needed a book that started at the beginning, that told the story from the moment God existed and nothing else did. -- I needed a book that was short and to-the-point, because these rambunctious boys were not going to stay focused for more than a few minutes. -- I needed a book that told the whole story&#x2013; how Jesus was promised from the garden and everything we learn after that just pointed to Him. "So, what does any writer-of-a-woman do? I grabbed a composition notebook and pencil and a box of crayons, and made my own."

James took his own life in January 1974. He was 27, gay and the author of one poetry book published in 1973 by Houghton Mifflin; it received little attention. However, since then, in American poetry's back rooms, a kind of cult has grown around it&#x2014;passed from poet to poet in photocopy, <i>Letters to a Stranger</i> has become an underground classic, largely due to an obsessive campaign by the poet Lucie Brock-Broido, who has written a shimmering epistolary introduction for this edition, which includes 13 uncollected poems, and is the second volume in Graywolf's Re/ View reissue series. James was enthralled by Plath's <i>Ariel</i>, suicide and the transformative capacities of his own verbal music. Mostly dramatic monologues, his poems speak directly to their stranger, haunted (I am heir to the old decisions) and hauntingly true: It is easy to surrender to the point of a needle:/ It is like lying down to love.... Self-dramatizing, brilliantly imaginative, wildly sad, they long, with romantic futility, to be heard, reveling and wallowing in the wide spaces of their privacy: I will last forever. I am not impatient, says James, in the voice of a mummified Egyptian noble, as if aware his book would last: I'll lie here till the world swims back again. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It covered 2,000 kilometres and was raced in appalling conditions across the battlefields of the Western Front, otherwise known as the Zone Rouge. The race was so tough that only 21 riders finished, and it was never staged again.</p><p>With one of the most demanding routes ever to feature in a bicycle race, and plagued by appalling weather conditions, the Circuit des Champs de Bataille was beyond gruelling, but today its extraordinary story is largely forgotten. Many of the riders came to the event straight from the army and had to ride 18-hour stages through sleet and snow across the battlefields on which they had fought, and lost friends and family, only a few months before.

In the wake of this violence, a vibrant pan-Mayan movement has emerged, one that is challenging Ladino (non-indigenous) notions of citizenship and national identity. In <i>The Blood of Guatemala</i> Greg Grandin locates the origins of this ethnic resurgence within the social processes of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century state formation rather than in the ruins of the national project of recent decades. <br> Focusing on Mayan elites in the community of Quetzaltenango, Grandin shows how their efforts to maintain authority over the indigenous population and secure political power in relation to non-Indians played a crucial role in the formation of the Guatemalan nation. To explore the close connection between nationalism, state power, ethnic identity, and political violence, Grandin draws on sources as diverse as photographs, public rituals, oral testimony, literature, and a collection of previously untapped documents written during the nineteenth century. He explains how the cultural anxiety brought about by Guatemala&#x2019;s transition to coffee capitalism during this period led Mayan patriarchs to develop understandings of race and nation that were contrary to Ladino notions of assimilation and progress. This alternative national vision, however, could not take hold in a country plagued by class and ethnic divisions. In the years prior to the 1954 coup, class conflict became impossible to contain as the elites violently opposed land claims made by indigenous peasants. <br> This &#x201c;history of power&#x201d; reconsiders the way scholars understand the history of Guatemala and will be relevant to those studying nation building and indigenous communities across Latin America.<p></p><p></p></p><p>&#x201c;Bold, fascinating, and important, The Blood of Guatemala is a model of careful, yet highly innovative and original scholarship.

When <i>The Book of Nonsense</i> was first published in 1845, under Lear's pseudonym, Derry Down Derry, it was a success--some say it turned the once stodgy, didactic world of children's literature on its head. <p> This rollicking poetic romp begins with "A Book of Nonsense" (1846), a slew of more-odd-than-bawdy limericks about the Young Lady of Wales, the Old Man of Vienna, and many, many more, all accompanied by the spare, whimsical ink drawings done by Lear himself. Part two urges readers to leap into "Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets" (1871), including the classic "The Owl and the Pussy-cat" and "The Jumblies" (who "went to sea in a Sieve"), along with equally rib-tickling but lesser known selections such as "The Nutcrackers and the Sugar-Tongs." In this section, you'll also discover instructions for how to make Crumbobblious Cutlets, a "Nonsense Botany" guide featuring the <i>Bottlephorkia spoonifolia</i> and the <i>Manypeeplia upsidownia</i>, and "Nonsense Alphabets," strange little poems about quills, rattlesnakes, screws, and other words beginning with letters. </p><p> Part three merrily inflicts "More Nonsense Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, &amp;c." (1877) on readers with the well-known plant <i>Washtubbia circularis</i> and more wacky limericks such as "There was an old person of Bar, / Who passed all her life in a jar, / Which she painted pea-green, to appear more serene, / That placid old person of Bar." As icing on a very strange cake, the last section offers "Laughable Lyrics, A Fourth Book of Nonsense Poems, Songs, Botany, Music, &amp;c." (1877), notably including "The Pobble Who Has No Toes." Lear's quirky sense of humor infuses every line of his ever skillful verse, which is often alliterative, and always very silly. Lear, the Laureate of Nonsense, frolics frivolously, and no one should ever go to sea in a Sieve without a copy of this book in tow. (All ages) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p><b>Edward Lear</b> (1812--1888) was an illustrator, natural history artist, and writer, though he is best known for his nonsense poems. His collection of poetry, <b>A BOOK OF NONSENSE</b>, was published in 1846 and helped to popularize the limerick, a humorous form of verse. His most famous poem, <b>THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT</b>, has been made into many picture books.</p><h2>Passing Through: The Later Poems, New and Selected</h2><p><p><strong>"Winner of the 1995 National Book Award, <em>Passing Through</em> confirms that the venerable doyen of American poetry is still a poet in his prime."&#x2015;<em>Atlantic Monthly</em></strong></p> Stanley Kunitz, one of the masters of contemporary poetry, presents his ninth collection, gathering a rich selection of his work, including new poems that remind us of his prefatory statement: "Art is the chalice into which we pour the wine of transcendence." Nearly all the poems of Kunitz's later years, beginning with The Testing-Tree (1971), are included, and most of the poems in <em>Passing Through</em> are unavailable in any other edition.<br><br> In "Touch Me," the last poem in the collection, Kunitz propounds a question, "What makes the engine go?" and gives us his answer: "Desire, desire, desire." These poems fairly hum with the energy, the excitement, the ardor, that make Kunitz one of our most enduring and highly honored poets. In the words of Carolyn Forch�, "he is a living treasure."</p><p>Marking his 90th birthday, this Stanley Kunitz greatest hits package is a treasure. &#34;The Wellfleet Whale&#34; is one of the best nature poems of the 20th century, but Kunitz shines brightest when writing about the family. Notice especially, &#34;The Portrait,&#34; which both describes a portrait found in an attic and is itself a portrait of Kunitz&#39;s childhood. The poem details a child finding a portrait of his dead father, a portrait that opens old wounds (&#34;My mother never forgave my father / for killing himself&#34;) even as new wounds are being formed. This is moving, potent, passionate writing.Stanley Kunitz, much-honored poet, was cofounder of the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and of Poets House in New York City. He died in 2006.</p><h2>Beyond the Reach of Time and Change: Native American Reflections on the Frank A. Rinehart Photograph Collection (Volume 53) (Sun Tracks)</h2><p><b>Around the turn of the twentieth century,</b> most photographs of Indians pandered to shameless, insensitive stereotypes. In contrast, photographic portraits made by Frank A. Rinehart conveyed the dignity and pride of Native peoples.&nbsp;More than 545 Native Americans representing tribes from all over the country attended the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition in Omaha in 1898 to be part of an event known as the Indian Congress. Rinehart, the exposition&#x2019;s official photographer, and his assistant Adolph Muhr made more than 500 glass-plate negatives depicting Native Americans in their traditional dress, now housed at Haskell Indian Nations University and regarded as one of the best photographic documentations of Indian leaders from this era.<br><br> This book provides an unusual perspective on the Rinehart collection. It features one hundred outstanding images printed from the original negatives made by Rinehart and Muhr at the Congress and over the course of the next two years. It also includes 14 essays by modern Native American writers, artists, and educators&#x2014;some of them descendants of the individuals photographed&#x2014;reflecting on the place of these images in their heritage.<br><br><i>Beyond the Reach of Time and Change</i> is not another coffee-table book of historical Indian photographs but rather a conversation between Indian people of a century ago and today. Just as the Rinehart collection offers today's Native Americans a unique connection to the past, this book offers all readers a positive understanding of continuity and endurance within the American Indian community.</p><p>Poet, fiction writer, essayist, and storyteller Simon Ortiz is a native of Acoma Pueblo and is the author of numerous books.&#x201c;An important perspective that should deepen and complicate our conversations about native history and identity.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Montana: The Magazine of Western History</i></p><h2>The 2-Day Diet: Diet two days a week.

MICHELLE HARVIE is an award-winning research dietitian at Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention. PROFESSOR TONY HOWELL is Professor of Medical Oncology and Research Director of Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention.1<br><br> why The 2-Day Diet works<br><br> If you are someone who has tried, and failed, to lose weight, or you&#x2019;ve shed the extra pounds only to pile them back on again&#x2014;this is the book for you. The 2-Day Diet is a brand new, research-based approach to weight loss that can work for you whether you&#x2019;ve been struggling with your weight for years or have only just made the decision to lose weight. The 2-Day Diet is simple: you diet for just two consecutive days a week and eat normally for the other five days.<br><br> I have never dieted and successfully kept the weight off &#x2014;before I tried The 2-Day Diet. In fact, I have always regained the weight and then usually extra, too.&nbsp; The 2-Day Diet is different&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a lifestyle change that I can actually live with. &#x2014;Marie, 33<br><br> We have become used to diet experts telling us that if we want to lose weight, there are strict rules that we must follow every day. The 2-Day Diet approach turns all of that theory on its head. It&#x2019;s flexible, it&#x2019;s easy to follow, and it will make you rethink your approach to dieting and find a different way to lose your unwanted pounds.<br><br> The idea of escaping the day-in, day-out restriction of a seven- day diet regime&#x2014;dieting for just two days a week and eating normally for the other five days and still losing weight&#x2014;prob- ably sounds too good to be true. But it&#x2019;s not: our weight-loss research over the last 17 years with dieters, many of them serial dieters, shows that this new approach really can work, even when everything else has failed. The 2-Day Diet has been designed by research dietitian Dr. Michelle Harvie, and, as well as delivering healthy, sustainable weight loss, The 2-Day Diet is nutritionally balanced to meet all your body&#x2019;s needs.<br><br> Dieting on the two days was much easier than I had expected. I also found that I was much more mindful of my eating over the five normal eating days&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t want to undo all that good work! &#x2014;Lizzie, 24<br><br> Warning<br><br> You should not attempt The 2-Day Diet if you are a child, a teenager, pregnant, breast-feeding, suffering from depression, or have an eating disorder. The moderately high levels of protein in this diet may pose problems for anyone with kidney disease or anyone at risk of kidney disease. If you have diabetes or any other medical condition, or if you are taking medication, seek advice from your doctor before embarking on any diet and exercise program.<br> If you are overweight, your main motivation for dieting may be to improve your self-esteem by regaining your true figure. You will lose weight on The 2-Day Diet, but you will also improve your health, protect yourself against disease, and boost your energy levels. Research shows that losing even a small amount of excess weight (5 to 10 percent of your body weight) can help reduce your risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. What&#x2019;s more, there&#x2019;s evidence to show that losing weight with The 2-Day Diet has the potential to have even greater health benefits than those gained by using a daily dieting weight-loss plan, as we will explain later.<br><br> The diet trap<br><br> In theory, losing weight should be easy. Eat less, move around more, and the pounds should simply melt away. In practice, losing weight can be anything but easy. You might be able to lose a few pounds in the short term, but they soon creep back on again. Despite major public health campaigns and millions of dollars spent each year on diet products, the number of people who are overweight keeps on rising in almost all parts of the world, but particularly in the USA and UK. In 2010, 64 percent of American women and 74 percent of men were overweight. These figures occur alongside reports estimating that 108 million people in the USA follow weight-loss diets each year, spending $20 billion per annum on diet books, diet drugs and weight-loss surgery. A 2007 MORI survey found that the average UK woman spends 31 years of her life on a diet, yet British women are now the heaviest in Europe. British men don&#x2019;t fare much better&#x2014;66 percent are now overweight, positioning them as the second-heaviest in Europe. It&#x2019;s clearly time for a new approach.<br><br> I can see and feel the weight loss, so I feel better&nbsp; about myself. I don&#x2019;t feel so tired&#x2014;I have so much&nbsp; more energy in the evenings. &#x2014;Jane, 32<br><br> The story behind The 2-Day Diet<br><br> Our search for a different way to lose weight was driven by our work over nearly two decades with women diagnosed with, or at high risk from, breast cancer. We knew from our research and work done elsewhere that while being overweight signi- ficantly increases women&#x2019;s risk of developing breast cancer, losing weight&#x2014;even as little as 10 lb (4.5 kg)&#x2014;can cut that risk by between 25 and 40 percent, compared with women who continue to gain weight, which is the norm.1 The problem is that losing weight&#x2014;and keeping it off&#x2014;is extraordinar- ily difficult. Typically the dieters we worked with had already made between three and five serious attempts to lose weight. However motivated they were and however hard they tried, less than half of them managed to shed the weight needed to reduce their risk. Many enjoyed amazing short-term success and displayed extraordinary willpower and determination, but, sadly, for most, the weight loss didn&#x2019;t last.<br><br> case study: Anne<br><br> Anne&#x2019;s story is typical. Anne was desperate to lose weight, know- ing that it was increasing her risk of developing the breast cancer that had already affected her mother, aunt, and cousin, and her chance of developing type 2 diabetes, which had affected her father&#x2019;s side of the family. She had previously managed to lose 42 lbs (19 kg) at a weight-loss group over a period of five months. This must have involved her eating 900 calories less than she normally ate each day for five months&#x2014;133,000 fewer calories in all! However, unfortunately, after all this effort, she regained most of the weight within four months.<br><br> Typically people stick with a diet for three to six months and lose around 14 lbs (6.4 kg) in weight. The majority of people&#x2014;80 percent&#x2014;then put most of the weight back on again, while the remaining 20 percent regain some weight but remain 8&#x2013;12 lbs (3.6&#x2013;5.4 kg) lighter than their pre-diet weight.2<br><br> So dieting isn&#x2019;t entirely in vain, since it can prevent you from gaining even more weight in the longer term. However, the process of constantly losing and regaining weight is demor- alizing, can lower your self-esteem, and can undermine subsequent attempts to lose weight. As many dieters are only too aware, dieting is a constant drudge.<br><br> Thanks to The 2-Day Diet I feel less sluggish, less bloated, less tired after exercise, much healthier, and my clothes now fit more comfortably. &#x2014;Honor, 45<br><br> The size of the problem<br><br> From 1950&#x2013;1960 33 percent of adults in the US were overweight (defined as a BMI of 25 or higher) and 9.7 percent&nbsp; were classified as obese (with a BMI of 30 or higher). The latest figures show that 6 percent of women are overweight and 36 percent obese, while 74 percent of men are overweight with 36 percent obese. Very roughly you can think of it this way: one-third of us are a healthy weight, one-third are overweight, and one-third obese.<br><br> The US government currently spends as much as $147 million each year on weight-related problems, which could rise to $334 billion a year by 2018.<br><br> A recent study by Duke University Medical Center reported that overweight workers miss 12 times more work days than non-obese workers.<br><br> In 2006, the United Nations announced that for the first time, the number of overweight people in the world exceeded those who were undernourished, with more than 1.3 billion people overweight and 800 million underweight.<br> Why diet for just two days a week?<br><br> Our initial studies between 1995 and 2005 used the conven- tional dieting approach and asked our Dieters to cut down calories on all seven days of the week. It became clear that many struggled with this standard approach, as they found themselves constantly having to think about their diet and what they were eating. By 2005, intriguing evidence of &#x201c;intermittent dieting,&#x201d; where calories are restricted for some days of the week, with a normal dietary intake for the other days, had started to emerge from scientists working in the fields of cancer and dementia. Papers published in 2002 and 2003 described how animals in the laboratory that were placed on intermittent diets developed significantly fewer cancers and less dementia than their counterparts that were following standard daily restricted diets.5,6 Although these original studies involved animals rather than people, the findings got us thinking. Most diets expect people to cut calories every day of the week, typically eating 25 percent fewer calories each day and sticking to that regime. But what would happen if you did most of your dieting during two strictly observed days each week when you had around 70 percent fewer calories on these two days rather than trying to cut down by the usual 25 percent every day? Dieting for just two days each week could be a relief from the chore of having to diet every single day, which so many people struggle with. At the same time, two days is long enough to reduce your overall weekly calories, retrain your eating habits, and, crucially, it seemed to have the potential to be more achievable. Would this approach be easier to follow than a daily diet? Could it be a better and more effective way to lose weight?<br><br> So back in 2006 we started researching two-day diets with funding from Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention and two other cancer charities (Breast Cancer Campaign and the World Cancer Research Fund), all of whom wanted to find more effective weight-loss approaches to help reduce cancer risk.<br><br> The 2-Day Diet is a much more straightforward diet&nbsp; than any other I&#x2019;ve been on. The two days &#x201c;on&#x201d; are easy<br><br> to deal with if you put in a tiny amount of planning, and&nbsp; doing it two days a week really makes you respect food on&nbsp; the days you aren&#x2019;t doing it. I lost 5 lb (2 kg) in the first<br><br> 10 days and I don&#x2019;t have that &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on a diet&#x201d; feeling.<br><br> &#x2014;Matt, 41<br><br> Our first 2-Day Diet<br><br> The first 2-Day Diet we devised included two days of&nbsp; 650-calorie intake that only permitted milk, yogurt, fruit, vegetables, and unlimited low-calorie drinks such as water, tea, coffee, and diet drinks. The 650-calorie days were care- fully designed to ensure that the Dieters met their nutritional requirements. Our 2-Day Dieters followed this diet for two consecutive days each week, eating a healthy Mediterranean diet (see page 70) for the other five days. They were then compared with a group of dieters who were asked to reduce their overall calorie intake by the same amount as the 2-Day Dieters, but by eating a standard, reduced-food intake every day of the week. A total of 107 women took part.<br><br> What we learned<br><br> We were encouraged by the results from this study. There was some evidence that, although the results were not substantially different from standard daily dieting, a two-day approach might be easier for some people to follow and have the potential for weight loss.<br><br> After six months, 54 percent of the 2-Day Dieters and 51 percent of the daily dieters were successful and had lost at least 5 percent of their weight. The 2-Day Dieters who stuck with the Diet for six months lost, on average, 17 lb (7.7 kg)&nbsp; of weight, of which 13� lb (6 kg) was fat, as well as 3 in (7.6 cm) from their waists, and 21&#x2044;3 in (6 cm) from their hips and bust. Some lost far more, with weight losses of 46 lb&nbsp; (21 kg) and dropping at least three clothes sizes. For daily dieters, on average there was a 13 lb 9 oz (6.3 kg) weight loss, a 10 lb 8 oz (4.9 kg) loss of fat, and a loss of 2 in (5 cm) from the waist and bust.<br><br> Moreover, two-day dieting appeared to deliver greater health benefits than the daily diet. Both approaches were beneficial, but our 2-Day Dieters had a 25 percent greater improvement in their insulin function than the daily dieters when we measured this five days after their restriction. They had a further 25 percent reduction during and on the morning immediately after their two restricted days.7 Insulin plays a vital role in regulating sugar levels in the body. Poor insulin function is a serious problem in modern life and is at the root of many weight-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, and possibly dementia. A large waist measurement is also associated with a greater risk of many of these diseases, and our 2-Day Dieters also lost proportionately more weight from the waist than the seven-day dieters.<br><br> The intermittent diet approach could even be used for weight maintenance. Our 2-Day Dieters who lost weight switched to just one restricted day a week, kept the weight off, and maintained the health benefits for the 15 months of the study&#x2014;importantly, they maintained the reductions in insulin and cholesterol they had achieved with the diet.<br><br> Our new, improved 2-Day Diet<br><br> Using the lessons we had learned throughout our original diet research, we developed The 2-Day Diet, which forms the focus of this book.<br><br> Predictably the main downside of our original 2-Day Diet was that the food choices were so limited. Many of the Dieters on the trial found that only being able to have milk, yogurt, fruit, and vegetables was hard to stick to, and only one-third of them were still following the diet by the end of a year. But we were so encouraged by the findings from our early research that we improved the Diet to include a greater variety of foods and included more protein foods to make the Diet more satisfying, filling, and easier to maintain long-term. Once again we tested The 2-Day Diet with two groups of women: one group doing the new, improved 2-Day Diet, the other a standard daily diet.</p><h2>The Ghosts of Birds</h2><p><p><strong><strong>A new collection from &#x201c;one of the world&#x2019;s great essayists&#x201d; (<em>The New York Times</em>)</strong></strong></p><em>The Ghosts of Birds</em> offers thirty-five essays by Eliot Weinberger: the first section of the book continues his linked serial-essay, <em>An Elemental Thing</em>, which pulls the reader into &#x201c;a vortex for the entire universe&#x201d; (<em>Boston Review</em>).

(Terry Richard <i>OregonLive.com</i>)</p><h2>Person-to-Person Astrology: Energy Factors in Love, Sex and Compatibility</h2><p>Using a new language of energy based on the ancient &#x201c;four elements&#x201d; and in harmony with that used by the more advanced healing arts, renowned author Stephen Arroyo here explores how astrology as a language of energy can be astoundingly accurate and useful in illuminating individuals&#x2019; energy exchange in all close relationships. The preface, author&#x2019;s note, introduction, and early chapters of <i>Person-to-Person Astrology </i>lay the groundwork for serious consideration of astrology as a significant discipline. The following chapters detail the influence of the four elements&#x2014;Fire, Earth, Water, Air&#x2014;on the 12 signs, with a particular emphasis on the rising sign (Ascendant). The author shows readers how to experiment by comparing birth charts, and explains, through detailed descriptions, people&#x2019;s psychological motivations and needs based on the positions of their Moon, Venus, and Mars. Appendices include astrological definitions, keywords, and sign tables that allow readers quick access to the basics. Written in the author&#x2019;s trademark clear, accessible style, <i>Person-to-Person Astrology </i>presents a new approach to finding fulfillment in any kind of relationship.</p><p>Stephen Arroyo, MA (psychology), has authored eight books, which have made him one of the best-selling authors of modern astrology books worldwide. His work has now been translated into 20 languages, and he has been awarded the British Astrological Association Astrology Prize, the Fraternity of Canadian Astrologers&#x2019; International Sun Award, and United Astrology Congress&#x2019;s Regulus Award.Arroyo&#x2019;s work spans the spectrum of modern, psychologically oriented astrology, supported by his many years of one-to-one counseling work (he holds a California Marriage, Family &amp; Child Counseling license) and also practicing body- and energy-centered therapies such as Polarity Therapy. In addition to numerous appearances in the USA, Arroyo has been a guest speaker or seminar leader in the UK, Spain, France, Italy, Mexico, and Switzerland. He also taught some of the first college courses on astrology in the USA, at four different schools.&#x201c;...Arroyo sees astrology as a powerful instrument of <i>transformation</i>&#x2014;psychological, spiritual, relational. Every new publication by Arroyo is a significant event for the field, and with <i>Person-to-Person</i> <i>Astrology</i> we receive the fruits of his past thirty years of observations on the astrology of human relations.&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard Tarnas, PhD, professor of philosophy and psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies and author of <i>Cosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View</i>"...[O]ne of the most comprehensive, explicit guides to the psychology of relationships... Anyone interested in the astrology of relationships would be well advised to get this book before anything else."&#x2014;<i>Horoscope</i> Magazine"<i>Person-to-Person Astrology: Energy Factors in Love, Sex and Compatability</i> by Stephen Arroyo explores the ways astrology can illuminate expectations needs and motivations."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Running Science (Sport Science)</h2><p><p> More than 50 years ago, New Zealand&#x2019;s Arthur Lydiard started using terms like base training, periodization, and peaking. His U.S. counterpart, Bill Bowerman, brought Lydiard&#x2019;s term for what until then had been called roadwork, or jogging, to the States. Soon after, the 1970s running boom started, spurred by exercise-advocating research from the growing fields of exercise science and sports medicine and from enthusiasts such as Jim Fixx, author of <i>The Complete Book of Running</i>. One of Bowerman&#x2019;s former runners at the University of Oregon, Phil Knight, saw to it that those millions of new runners had swoosh-adorning footwear designed specifically for their sport. </p><p> The pace of knowledge enhancement and innovation has, in fact, been so brisk through the years that even highly informed runners could be excused for not keeping up, but no longer.<i> Running Science</i> is a one-of-a-kind resource: </p><p> � An easily comprehended repository of running research </p><p> � A wealth of insights distilled from great sport and exercise scientists, coaches, and runners </p><p> � A do-it-right reference for a host of techniques and tactics </p><p> � An array of the most credible and widely used training principles and programs </p><p> � Perhaps most of all, a celebration of the latest science-based know-how of running, now truly the world&#x2019;s most popular sport </p><p> Elite running coach Owen Anderson presents this comprehensive work in a compelling way for runners. A PhD and coach himself, Anderson has both a great enthusiasm for sharing what scientific studies offer the running community and a keen sense of what&#x2019;s really important for today&#x2019;s informed runners to know. </p></p><p><p><b>Owen Anderson, PhD</b>, has been a regular contributor to <i>Runner&#x2019;s World, Shape, Men&#x2019;s Health, Peak Performance, National Geographic Adventure</i>, and <i>Sports Injury Bulletin</i>. He has written extensively on the topics of running training, strength training for running, sports nutrition, and injury prevention, and he developed the neural system of training, which diminishes the emphasis on mileage and promotes the use of high-quality running and the progression of running-specific strength training to achieve optimal running fitness. </p><p> Anderson is the founder of Lansing Sports Management, which coaches elite athletes from Kenya and manages their international competitions. He has enjoyed a successful career coaching runners of all levels, including notables such as Benjamin Simatei, the winner of the Park Forest 10-mile race in Chicago, Illinois, and Chemtai Rionotukei, who in 2012 and 2013 has six victories, two course records, and 14 top-four finishes in U.S. road races, including a win at the 2013 Fifth Third River Bank 25K. </p><p> Anderson is the race director of the annual Lansing Marathon, Lansing Half Marathon, and Ekiden Relay. In addition, he hosts running camps throughout the U.S., including the Lansing Marathon Running Camp in Thetford Center, Vermont. Anderson is also the CEO of Lansing Moves the World, a nonprofit foundation that coordinates three projects, including an after school program for Lansing children age 9 to 14, a tree planting program in east Africa, and a program for families and children victimized by the recent violence in the Tana River Delta district of Kenya. </p><p> Anderson was awarded a National Science Foundation fellowship and completed his PhD at Michigan State University. </p></p><h2>Four Seconds to Lose: A Novel (The Ten Tiny Breaths Series)</h2><p>When a gorgeous young dancer walks through his door, a strip club owner must decide whether to follow his rules or his heart in the third novel by the author of <i>One Tiny Lie</i> and <i>Ten Tiny Breaths</i>.<br><br><b>I believe you don&#x2019;t have years, or months, or weeks to impact a person&#x2019;s life.

And though her fellow dancers seem eager to nab their sexy, sophisticated, and genuinely caring boss, she&#x2019;s not interested.

The stocky brute facing me�&#x20ac;&#x201d;his bottom lip split open, an angry cut across his cheekbone�&#x20ac;&#x201d;can account for some of that. But given the colossal beating I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m taking at the hands of this recently paroled rapist, most of that blood is probably mine.<br> <br>Holding my left elbow tight against the ribs that he just splintered with a series of powerful blows, I struggle not to wince as my feet shuffle back toward the ropes of the makeshift ring. Screams and shouts bombard me from all angles, echoing through the underground parking lot of the downtown business building. Normally I have a decent crowd of rich bitches throwing their names, numbers, and �&#x20ac;&#x153;pretty boy�&#x20ac; comments at me. Not tonight, though. All of these people took the twenty-to-one odds against me and they�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re no doubt picturing sandy beaches and shiny BMWs.<br> <br>Hell, I almost bet against me. But, there�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s not a person in the world that I trust with that kind of money to place it for me. Except maybe Nate. But he�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s fourteen and a known associate of mine, so I might as well have painted a target on his head if I sent him to the bookie.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Come on, pansy ass!�&#x20ac; Jones bellows, slamming his meaty fists together, a wicked grin on his face.<br> <br>I remain silent as Nate splashes my face with cool water and I swig some back, trying to rinse the coppery taste out of my mouth. I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve heard this guy likes to draw his beatings out, so I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m not worried about him charging me like a bull. I am worried about the crowd shoving me in, though. I can feel their impatience swelling in the air over my pause. They want to see my skull hit the ground. Now. This is real underground fighting. The kind that brings the high-rolling criminal element and thrill-seekers together like family at Christmas. There are no weight classes here. No drug tests. No rules. No true refereeing. The match doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t end until one fighter�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s broken body is collected off the ground.<br> <br>Not exactly the world a loving father would introduce his son into. But I don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t have a loving father. I have a mean wannabe-mobster prick of a dad, who�&#x20ac;&#x201d;after pounding on me enough to teach me how to hold my own and harden my muscles beyond their years�&#x20ac;&#x201d;decided he could make some real cash by throwing me into L.A.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s illegal fighting scene. At the age of seventeen, when my body wasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t even fully developed but was solid on account of the grueling workouts my dad insisted on. I can�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t say that I went unwillingly. I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve even enjoyed it, most times. It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s always my dad�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s face I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m bashing in, his bones I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m snapping, every time I raise my fists.<br> <br>Every time I pulverize my opponent. <br> <br>And now, at nineteen years old, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve ended up fighting for my life in the upper echelon of this illicit world. I could win big on this one with what I put down. Or I could end up in a body bag. As I gaze at the goon in front of me�&#x20ac;&#x201d;steroid-enhanced pecs twitching with anticipation, ugly veins protruding from his neck, his face a hideous mess of blood and ink�&#x20ac;&#x201d;I accept that I probably won�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t be the last one standing here, tonight. I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m a fucking moron for showing up to this fight. Jones is likely high on meth. Nothing short of two shots of fentanyl is going to bring the animal to his knees, and I don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t have elephant tranquilizers in my back pocket.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Zee!�&#x20ac; Nate�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s voice cracks behind me, using my fighter name. I glance over my shoulder at the scrawny kid in my corner. My only reliable confidante, the one by my side through every single fight. He�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s holding his cell phone to his ear, his ebony skin turned a sickly ashen tinge. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Somethin�&#x20ac;&#x2122; big is going down at Wilcox.�&#x20ac; Wilcox. My parents�&#x20ac;&#x2122; street. Nate�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s wide molasses eyes flicker to my waiting opponent before returning to my mangled face.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;They fighting again?�&#x20ac; I ask. It wouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t be the first time.<br> <br>Nate�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s head shakes slowly, somberly. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Nah, something different. Benny saw two guys show up about twenty minutes ago.�&#x20ac; Benny�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s a fifteen-year-old kid who lives across the street from my parents and goes to Nate�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s school with him. He�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s a shithead, but he worships Nate because Nate is connected to me.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;For him or her?�&#x20ac; As disturbing as the question is, it�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s valid. Both of my parents took entrepreneurial paths down the wrong side of morality�&#x20ac;&#x201d;my dad venturing into the drug trade, my mother running a quaint bookkeeping business/ brothel out of my late grandmother�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s house. And now one of them has clearly pissed someone off enough to track them down on their doorstep. <br> <br>Normally, I wouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t give a shit. I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d be ecstatic. Maybe, if my dad pissed off the right people, they�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d get rid of my problem for me. Only it�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s one in the morning on a Tuesday, and Lizzy, my sixteen-year-old sister, could be asleep in her bed. And, if these guys came looking for money and my dad goes to the hollowed-out armchair to pay them off, he�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s going to find it empty.<br> <br>Because I stole every last bill earlier today to put down on this fight.<br> <br>A new visual blazes in my head. One of these guys collecting their payment on Lizzy.<br> <br>That�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s all it takes for my adrenaline to kick in. The crippling pain in my side instantly vanishes as I look at my opponent through new eyes. If I bury the odometer needle, I can get to their house in under fifteen minutes. It may be enough time. It may not. This goon is the only thing stopping me from leaving right now.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Nate, tell Benny to call the cops.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>I toss my water bottle to the ground and charge forward.<br> <br>It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s over so fast, no one watching seems to know what the hell happened. Silence fills the vast parking lot as everyone waits for Jones to get up. Everyone except me. I know he�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s not getting up for a while. I felt the bones crack as his head snapped to the side with the venomous blows that I delivered in quick succession.<br> <br>He still hasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t moved as my peeling tires screech up the underground ramp.<br> <br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;&#x25a0;&nbsp;&#x25a0;<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Stay here,�&#x20ac; I bark at Nate as I pull my GTO to a stop in the middle of the street. I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m not sure how I didn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t crash, given that one eye is swollen shut. I jump out, running past the crowd of curious onlookers, toward the throng of emergency vehicles and police officers, lights flashing, cops running with radios in their hands. They couldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t have beaten us by more than ten minutes.<br> <br>It takes four police officers, a gun aimed at my forehead, and a set of handcuffs to stop me. They won�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t let me go in. They won�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t answer the one damn question I ask over and over again. Is Lizzy okay? Instead, they hammer me with an onslaught of words that don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t register, that I don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t care to acknowledge.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;What happened to you, son?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Who did this to you, son?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;You need medical attention.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;How do you know the occupants of this home?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Where have you been since midnight until your arrival here?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>Despite my warning, Nate ventures out of my car and somehow slips through the police tape. Like a silent shadow, he waits with me as a young paramedic tapes the gash above my eyebrow and informs me that I have three broken ribs.<br> <br>I barely hear her as I watch a parade march in and out of my parents�&#x20ac;&#x2122; front door.<br> <br>As I watch the coroner show up.<br> <br>The beginning of dawn lights the sky when one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. three gurneys finally roll out.<br> <br>All topped with black bags.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m sorry for your loss, son,�&#x20ac; a stocky police officer with a gruff voice offers. I didn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t catch his name. I don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t care about his name. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Things like this shouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t happen.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>He�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s right. They shouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t. Lizzy shouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t have been there in the first place. If I hadn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t given up on her, if I hadn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t kicked her out of my apartment, she wouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t have.<br> <br>I could have saved her.<br> <br>But now I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m too late.<br> <br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;&#x25a0;&nbsp;&#x25a0;<br> <br>Present Day<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;What do you mean you can�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t deliver until after the weekend?�&#x20ac; Despite every effort to keep my cool, my tone is biting.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Sir, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m sorry. As I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve already explained, we�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re experiencing labor shortages. We�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re working as fast as we can to cover orders. We�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re sorry for the inconvenience,�&#x20ac; the customer service rep recites evenly, sounding like she has said it a hundred times today. Because I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m sure she has.<br> <br>Pinching the bridge of my nose to dull the sudden headache forming, I fight the urge to slam the receiver against the desk. This conversation is a complete waste of time. It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s the same one I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve had every day for two weeks. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Tell your management that �&#x20ac;&#x2dc;inconvenient�&#x20ac;&#x2122; isn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t the right word.�&#x20ac; I hang up before she has a chance to spew the prewritten response for that.<br> <br>With a groan, I lean back in my leather chair and fold my arms behind my head. I survey the walls of my office�&#x20ac;&#x201d;lined floor-to-ceiling with shelves, doubling as supply room overflow. Five weeks of abnormally busy nights at Penny�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s coupled with sporadic beer deliveries means I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m out of our top brands for the coming weekend. That means I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll have to spend yet another Saturday night explaining to customers why being out of Heineken doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t entitle them to a free lap dance.<br> <br>I hate this business, some days.<br> <br>Lately, I hate this business all days. <br> <br>Cracking open a fresh bottle of high-end Rémy Martin, I pour the deep golden liquid into my tumbler. It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s my vice�&#x20ac;&#x201d;a glass before the club opens to take the edge off and one to close the place down. Unfortunately, the edge doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t come off so easily anymore and I find myself topping up the glass a lot. It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s a good thing our hours are limited or I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d have a drinking problem. At two hundred bucks a bottle, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d also have a money problem.<br> <br>My office door cracks open just as the comforting burn slides down my throat.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Cain?�&#x20ac; Nate�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s deep voice rumbles a second before his six-foot-six, 280-pound frame eases through the doorway. I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m still in awe of how that twiggy little kid turned into the giant now standing before me, almost overnight, too. It shouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t surprise me, though, given that I was the one footing the steep grocery bill through his teenage growth spurts. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Just got a text from Cherry. She�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s sick.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;She texted you?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>He nods slowly, his dark eyes never leaving mine.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;That�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s the third time she�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s called in sick in two weeks.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Yup,�&#x20ac; he agrees, and I know his thoughts are on the same wavelength as mine. No one knows me better than Nate. In fact, no one really knows me but Nate.<br> <br>Cherry has worked for me for three and a half years. She has the immune system of a shark. The last time she started missing shifts because she was �&#x20ac;&#x153;sick,�&#x20ac; we found her battered and strung out on blow, thanks to her douchebag boyfriend.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Do you think he�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s back?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>I shove my fingers through my hair, gritting my teeth with rising frustration. �&#x20ac;&#x153;He�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d be the world�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s biggest moron if he is, after what happened the last time.�&#x20ac; Nate put him in the hospital with a broken femur and two dislocated shoulders as a warning. I have to think that was an effective deterrent.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Unless Cherry invited him over.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>I roll my eyes. She�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s a good girl with low self-esteem and terrible taste in men. Though I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d be surprised, I wouldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t put it past her. I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve seen it happen before. Many times.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;I think I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll just swing by her place to make sure this isn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t something more than a bug or chick issues.�&#x20ac; Nate grabs his keys from the rack. <br> <br>With a sigh, I grumble, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Thanks Nate.�&#x20ac; We�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve helped her stay clean and idiot-boyfriend free for a year. The last thing I want to see is a repeat. �&#x20ac;&#x153;And, here.�&#x20ac; I pull a twenty-dollar bill out of my wallet and toss it across my desk. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Her kid loves Big Macs.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>Nate scowls at my money, leaving it where it lays. I should know better. �&#x20ac;&#x153;And if he�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s there?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;If he�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s back in the picture&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.�&#x20ac; I run my tongue over my teeth. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t do anything yet. Call me. Immediately.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>With a lazy salute, Nate exits my office, leaving me with my elbows on my desk and my folded hands against my clenched mouth, wondering what I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m going to do if Cherry has taken a turn for the worse. I can�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t fire her. Not when she needs our help. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fuck. If we have to go through this with her again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>And I had to convince Delyla to go back to counseling just last week because she started cutting again. And two weeks before that, we were rushing Marisa to the hospital with complications after the back-street abortion that her asshole boyfriend convinced her to undergo. She hasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t even made it back to work yet. And the week before that�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<br> <br>A knock on my door only seconds later makes my temper flare unexpectedly. �&#x20ac;&#x153;What!�&#x20ac; <br> <br>Ginger�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s face pokes in.<br> <br>Taking a deep breath, I gesture her in with a �&#x20ac;&#x153;sorry,�&#x20ac; silently chastising myself for barking at her.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Hey, Cain, my friend is coming in to meet you tonight,�&#x20ac; she reminds me in that low, husky voice suitable for phone sex companies. The customers here love it. They love everything else about her, too, including those naturally large breasts and that sharp-witted tongue. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Remember? The one I mentioned earlier this week.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>I groan. I completely forgot. Ginger sprung it on me last Friday as I was refereeing an argument between Kinsley and China in the hallway. I never did agree to meet with this person but I didn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t say no. Ginger is clearly taking advantage of that. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Right. And she wants a job as what again? A dancer?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>Ginger�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s head bobs up and down, her wild short hair�&#x20ac;&#x201d;colored in chunks of platinum blond, honey, and pink�&#x20ac;&#x201d;in styled disarray. �&#x20ac;&#x153;I think you�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll like her, Cain. She�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s different.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Different, how?�&#x20ac; <br> <br>Ginger�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s hot pink lips twist. �&#x20ac;&#x153;Hard to explain. You�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll see when you meet her. You�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll like her.�&#x20ac; <br> <br>My hand finds its way to the back of my neck, trying to rub the permanent tension out. It won�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t work. Weekly trips to a massage therapist do nothing for the kind of knots this place creates. �&#x20ac;&#x153;It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s not about liking her, Ginger. It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s about being overstaffed. I don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t need any more dancers or bartenders right now.�&#x20ac; Given �Penny�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s reputation, this place has basically become the crème de la crème of adult entertainment clubs. I don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t take walk-ins or random applications. Employment is by referral only and turnover is low. Aside from Kinsley, I haven�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t hired anyone new in almost a year. Too many dancers means catfights over money.<br> <br>�&#x20ac;&#x153;I know, Cain, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think you�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re really going to like her.�&#x20ac; Ginger has been bartending for me for years, longer than anyone else. I trust her opinion of people. The three others she recommended turned out to be outstanding employees who are now on healthy life paths, leading far away from the sex trade business.

His body just wouldn&#x2019;t respond.<br> <br>The duplicate leaned in, hands reaching out for Owen . . .<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s when Owen woke up with a start.<br> <br>Wait, he&#x2019;d been asleep! It was just a dream! A scary, sweaty, awful dream.<br> <br>Owen wanted to laugh. &#x201c;It was all a dream&#x201d; was the worst possible ending to any story, but right now, it definitely felt comforting. It had felt much too real, though he supposed that was dreams for you. Owen ran his hands over his sheets, happy to still be in bed.<br> <br>Except his sheets felt a lot like carpet, and he wasn&#x2019;t lying on a pillow.<br> <br>Also, his carpet-feeling sheets were orange for some reason.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh?&#x201d; Owen said. He picked his head up a bit from the carpet, only to wince and drop his head back to the floor, squeezing his eyes shut. A huge ache pounded through his temples, and everything smelled weirdly smoky.<br> <br>He tried opening his eyes again, but even the little bit of light in the room caused his headache to scream at him. But Owen knew that orange carpet. He knew it like the back of his hand. Which, admittedly, he didn&#x2019;t know all that well, but still.<br> <br>This was the library. He was facedown on the floor of his mother&#x2019;s library.<br> <br>And he had no idea how he&#x2019;d gotten here.<br> <br>Gathering all of his courage, Owen opened his eyes again to look around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Owen?&#x201d; said a voice to his side, followed by a painful groan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kiel?&#x201d; Owen said, and groaned too as he turned slightly to face the direction the voice had come from.<br> <br>Kiel Gnomenfoot, former boy magician and hero to millions as star of his own book series, looked like he wanted to burst into tears. &#x201c;Owen,&#x201d; Kiel repeated, as if the word tasted bad. &#x201c;Why . . . head . . . hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen tried to bring up a word or two, something along the lines of I have no idea, but it&#x2019;s obviously for evil, evil reasons, but all he managed to croak out was, &#x201c;Unnh.&#x201d; Figuring that wasn&#x2019;t enough, he slapped his hand a few times on the floor, then cringed at the noise.<br> <br>How had he and Kiel gotten to his mom&#x2019;s library? The last thing Owen remembered was . . . wait, what was the last thing he remembered? It was like everything in the recent past was just gone. He remembered Kiel being introduced to their class as Kyle, a new student, but that was the last thing. How long ago had that been? And why couldn&#x2019;t he remember anything else?<br> <br>Thunder crashed, and Owen grabbed his head as it erupted in pain, which made him face-plant onto the floor. After a moment of pure agony, something more urgent than the ache seeped through his brain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you smell smoke?&#x201d; he asked Kiel. Owen pushed himself up and over onto his back, so at least he wouldn&#x2019;t hit his face again if he fell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; Kiel moaned from his side. &#x201c;Is something on fire?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dark black smoke began to curl into sight above Owen on the library&#x2019;s ceiling, and in spite of the pain, Owen immediately sat up. &#x201c;Kiel!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;The library&#x2019;s on fire!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No yelling!&#x201d; Kiel shouted back, and they both groaned. Kiel slowly pushed himself up too and looked around. &#x201c;Oh. Fire. That&#x2019;s not a good thing. Hold on, I&#x2019;ll use . . . whatever it is I do. Magic. To put it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Holding,&#x201d; Owen said, gritting his teeth and waiting. &#x201c;Hurry. Hurty.&#x201d;<br> <br>A pause, and then Kiel gasped. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not there!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What aren&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My wand-knives!&#x201d; he said, then paused. &#x201c;Owen, I can&#x2019;t remember any magic, and my spell book&#x2019;s gone too. I can&#x2019;t do magic without it or my wands.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A brilliant observation,&#x201d; said a too-deep, fake-sounding voice from behind them, as if someone was talking into a voice changer. &#x201c;Which begs the question, what exactly can you do, Mr. Gnomenfoot? What use are you without your magic?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen turned to find himself staring at a short figure wearing a brown overcoat, a Sherlock Holmes hat, and a white mask with a black question mark where the face should have been.<br> <br>Well. That wasn&#x2019;t good.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gentlemen,&#x201d; the masked figure said, crossing his arms over his chest. &#x201c;I would say the game is afoot, but unfortunately, your game is already over.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Destruction of Jerusalem: An Absolute and Irresistible Proof of the Divine Origin of Christianity</h2><p>A narrative of the calamities which befell the Jews so far as they tend to verify our Lord&#39;s predictions relative to that event.

Will they understand?</b></p><p>The endlessly fascinating question of whether we are alone in the universe has always been accompanied by another, more complicated one: if there is extraterrestrial life, how would we communicate with it? In this book, Daniel Oberhaus leads readers on a quest for extraterrestrial communication. Exploring Earthlings' various attempts to reach out to non-Earthlings over the centuries, he poses some not entirely answerable questions: If we send a message into space, will extraterrestrial beings receive it? Will they understand? What languages will they (and we) speak? Is there not only a universal grammar (as Noam Chomsky has posited), but also a grammar of the universe? </p><p>Oberhaus describes, among other things, a late-nineteenth-century idea to communicate with Martians via Morse code and mirrors; the emergence in the twentieth century of SETI (the search for extraterrestrial intelligence), CETI (communication with extraterrestrial intelligence), and finally METI (messaging extraterrestrial intelligence); the one-way space voyage of Ella, an artificial intelligence agent that can play cards, tell fortunes, and recite poetry; and the launching of a theremin concert for aliens. He considers media used in attempts at extraterrestrial communication, from microwave systems to plaques on spacecrafts to formal logic, and discusses attempts to formulate a language for our message, including the Astraglossa and two generations of Lincos (<i>lingua cosmica</i>).</p><p>The chosen medium for interstellar communication reveals much about the technological sophistication of the civilization that sends it, Oberhaus observes, but even more interesting is the information embedded in the message itself. In <i>Extraterrestrial Languages</i>, he considers how philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, science, and art have informed the design or limited the effectiveness of our interstellar messaging.</p></p><p>Daniel Oberhaus is a science and technology journalist whose work has appeared in <i>Wired</i>, the <i>Atlantic,</i><i>Popular Mechanics</i>, <i>Slate</i>, the <i>Baffler</i>, <i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Vice,</i> the <i>Awl</i>, and other publications</p><h2>100 Ways to Simplify Your Life</h2><p>Joyce Meyer is one busy lady.

He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle.</p><p>We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)&#x2014;on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness&#x2014;and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, <i>Apocolocyntosis</i> (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes. Many epistles and all his speeches are lost.</p><p>The 124 epistles are collected in Volumes IV&#x2013;VI of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca.</p></p><p><p>Richard Mott Gummere (1883&#x2013;1969) taught Latin at Haverford College and served as Headmaster of the William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia and Dean of Admissions at Harvard College.</p></p><h2>The Last Innocents: The Collision of the Turbulent Sixties and the Los Angeles Dodgers</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the 2016 CASEY Award for Best Baseball Book of the Year</strong></p><p><strong>Finalist&nbsp;for the 2017 PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing</strong></p><p>From an award-winning journalist comes the riveting odyssey of seven Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1960s&#x2014;a chronicle of a team, a game, and a nation in transition during one of the most exciting and unsettled decades in history.</p><p>Legendary Dodgers Maury Wills, Sandy Koufax, Wes Parker, Jeff Torborg, Dick Tracewski, Lou Johnson, and Tommy Davis encapsulated 1960s America: white and black, Jewish and Christian, wealthy and working class, pro-Vietnam and anti-war, golden boy and seasoned veteran. <em>The Last Innocents</em> is a thoughtful, technicolor portrait of these seven players&#x2014;friends, mentors, confidants, rivals, and allies&#x2014;and their storied team that offers an intriguing look at a sport and a nation in transition. Bringing into focus the high drama of their World Series appearances from 1962 to 1972 and their pivotal games, Michael Leahy explores these men&#x2019;s interpersonal relationships and illuminates the triumphs, agonies, and challenges each faced individually.</p><p>Leahy places these men&#x2019;s lives within the political and social maelstrom that was the era when the conformity of the 1950s gave way to demands for equality and rights. Increasingly frustrated over a lack of real bargaining power and an oppressive management who meddled in their personal affairs, the players shared an uneasy relationship with the team&#x2019;s front office. This contention mirrored the discord and uncertainty generated by myriad changes rocking the nation: the civil rights movement, political assassinations, and growing hostility to the escalation of the Vietnam War. While the nation around them changed, these players each experienced a personal and professional metamorphosis that would alter public perceptions and their own.</p><p>Comprehensive and artfully crafted, <em>The Last Innocents</em> is an evocative and riveting portrait of a pivotal era in baseball and modern America.</p></p><p><p>WINNER OF THE CASEY AWARD FOR BEST BASEBALL BOOK OF THE YEAR</p><p>It&#x2019;s rare for a team to encapsulate an era as indelibly as the Los Angeles Dodgers did the 1960s. White, black, Jewish, Christian, wealthy, working-class, conservative, liberal&#x2014;the Dodgers embodied the disparate cultural forces at play in an America riven by race and war.</p><p>In <em>The Last Innocents</em>, Michael Leahy tells the story of this mesmerizing time and extraordinary team through seven players&#x2014;Maury Wills, Sandy Koufax, Wes Parker, Jeff Torborg, Tommy Davis, Dick Tracewski, and Lou Johnson&#x2014;taking readers through the high drama of their World Series appearances, pivotal triumphs, and individual setbacks while the Dodgers reigned and baseball was king.</p><p>It is a story about what it was like to be a major leaguer when the country was turned upside down by the tumult of the civil rights movement, a series of wrenching political assassinations, and the shock waves of the Vietnam War. Even as these seven Dodgers starred in games watched by millions, they coped with anxieties and indignities their fans knew nothing about. In their dissatisfaction, they helped plant the seeds of a rebellion that would change their sport.</p><p>Michael Leahy is the author of <em>Hard Lessons </em>and <em>When Nothing Else Matters: Michael Jordan&#x2019;s Last Comeback,</em>&nbsp;which was described by <em>GQ Magazine</em>&nbsp;as &#x201c;the best sports book of the year...easily the most fully formed portrait of Jordan ever written and one of the best sports books in recent memory.&#x201d;&nbsp;His award-winning career has included&nbsp;thirteen years as a writer for <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The Washington Post Magazine</em>.&nbsp;Leahy's 2005 <em>Washington Post Magazine</em> story about a California sperm donor won the Society of Professional Journalists&#x2019; <em>Sigma Delta Chi</em> Award for best magazine story of the year.

Just moments after four o'clock, a large split of snow separates from Jubilee Mountain high above the tiny hamlet and hurtles down the rocky slope, enveloping everything in its path.</p><p>Meet the residents whose lives this tragedy touches: Lucy and Dolly Patch, two sisters long estranged by a shocking betrayal. Joe Cobb, Swandyke's only black resident, whose love for his daughter forces him to flee Alabama. Then there's Grace Foote, who hides secrets and scandal that belie her genteel fa�ade. And Minder Evans, a Civil War veteran who considers cowardice his greatest sin. Finally, there's Essie Snowball, born Esther Schnable to conservative Jewish parents, who now works as a prostitute and hides her child's parentage from the world. </p><p>Fate, chance, and perhaps divine providence all collide in the everyday lives of these people. And ultimately, no one is without sin, no one's soul is whiter than snow, and no one is without the need for forgiveness. </p><p>A quintessential American voice and a writer of exquisite historical detail, Sandra Dallas illuminates the resilience of the human spirit in her newest novel.</p></p><p><p>Award-winning author <b>Sandra Dallas</b> was dubbed "a quintessential American voice" by Jane Smiley, in <i>Vogue Magazine</i>.

It might have been the dynamite charge that was set off at the end of shift on the upper level of the Fourth of July Mine. The miners claimed the blast was too far inside the mountain to be felt on the surface, and besides, they had set off dynamite hundreds, maybe thousands, of times before, and nothing bad had happened. Except for that one time when a charge failed to go off and Howard Dolan hit it with his pick when he was mucking out the stope and blew himself and his partner to kingdom come.</p><p>Still, who knew how the old mountain took retribution for having its insides clawed out.</p><p>Certainly there was nothing to suggest that the day was different from any other. It started chill and clear. The men, their coat collars turned up against the dawn cold, left for their shifts at the Fourth of July or on the dredge up the Swan River, dinner pails clutched in their mittened hands. A little later, the children went off to school, the older brothers and sisters pulling little ones on sleds. Groups of boys threw snowballs at one another. One grabbed onto the back of a wagon and slid along over the icy road behind it. The Connor girl slipped on the ice and fell over a stone embankment, hitting her head. It hurt so much that she turned around and went home crying. The others called her a crybaby, but after what happened later that day, her parents said the blessed God had taken her hand.</p><p>After the children were gone, the women washed the breakfast dishes and started the beans for dinner. Then because the sun came out bright enough to burn your skin in the thin air, came out after one of the worst blizzards they had ever encountered, they got out the washtubs and scrubbed the overalls and shirts, the boys&#x2019; knickers and the girls&#x2019; dresses. When the wash was rinsed and wrung, they climbed onto the platforms that held the clotheslines far above the snow and hung up the clothes, where they would dry stiff as boards in the wind. Then because it was such a fine day, as fine a day as ever was, they called to one another to come and visit. There was a bit of coffee to reheat, and won&#x2019;t you have a cup? Cookies, left over from the lunch pails, were set on plates on the oilcloth of the kitchen tables, and the women sat, feeling lazy and gossipy.</p><p>&#x201c;You know, the Richards girl had her baby last week,&#x201d; announced a woman in one of the kitchens, taking down the good china cups for coffee.</p><p>&#x201c;Was her husband the father?&#x201d; asked her neighbor.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have the nerve to ask.&#x201d;</p><p>In another house, a woman confided, &#x201c;The doctor says Albert has the cancer, but he won&#x2019;t have his lungs cut on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;ll die,&#x201d; her friend replied, muttering to herself, &#x201c;at last.&#x201d;</p><p>It was that kind of a day, one for confidences or lazy talk. The women blessed the bright sun after so many winter days of gloom. Nobody thought about an avalanche. What could cause trouble on a day the Lord had given them?</p><p>Maybe the cause was an animal&#x2014;a deer or an elk or even a mountain sheep&#x2014;making its way along the ridge of Jubilee Mountain. The weight of the beast would have been enough to loosen the snow. That happened often enough. Nobody saw an animal, but then, who was looking?</p><p>Or worthless Dave Buck might have set off the avalanche. He&#x2019;d put on snowshoes and taken his gun and gone high up to hunt for a deer&#x2014;a fawn, really, for Dave was too lazy to cut up the bigger carcass and haul it home. The company forbade hunting around the mine, but Dave didn&#x2019;t care. He snowshoed up near timberline, where he&#x2019;d seen the footprints of deer. He didn&#x2019;t find any, and he stopped to drink from a pint he&#x2019;d put into his pocket. One drink, and another, and he sat down beside a stunted pine and picked off the cones and slid them down the white slope. Then he tossed the bottle into that cornice of snow that dipped out over a ridge.</p><p>But perhaps it was nothing more than the spring melt. That storm a few days before had dumped five feet of snowfall on top of a dry, heavy base of winter-worn snow. The wind had driven the snow off ridges, leaving them barren, and piled it into large cornices high up. But now the day was cloudless, the sun shining down as harsh as if it had been midsummer. It was so bright that it hurt your eyes to see the glare on the white, and some of the miners rubbed charcoal under their eyes to cut the sharpness.</p><p>But who cared what the cause was? Something started the slide that roared down Jubilee Mountain in Swandyke, Colorado, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>There was a sharp crack like the sound of distant thunder, and then the cornice of snow where Dave Buck had thrown his bottle, a crusted strip two hundred feet long that flared out over the mountain ridge, fractured and fell. It landed on layers of snow that covered the mountain slope to a depth of more than six feet&#x2014;a heavy, wet, melting mass of new snow on top, falling on frozen layers of snowpack that lay on a bed of crumbled ice. That bottommost layer, a mass of loose ice crystals formed by freezing and thawing, lubricated the acres of snow lying on top of it just as much as if the bed had been made of marbles, and sent the snow careening down the mountain.</p><p>The miners called such a phenomenon a &#x201c;slab avalanche&#x201d; because a curtain of snow slid down the slope, picking up speed at a terrible rate, until it reached one hundred miles an hour. Nothing stood in the way of the terrifying slide, because the mountainside was bare of trees. They had been torn out forty years earlier in the second wave of mining that came after the prospectors abandoned gold pans and sluice boxes. Men had trained giant hoses on the mountain, washing dirt down the slope to be processed for precious minerals. Hydraulic mining, as it was called, also rid the mountainside of rocks and trees and underbrush that would have interfered with an avalanche&#x2014;not that anything could have held back the tons of white that slid down Jubilee Mountain that afternoon. The slide would have taken anything in its path.</p><p>This was not the first slide on Jubilee Mountain. The hillside, in fact, was known for avalanches. But it was the worst, and it spilled over into the forest at the edge of the&nbsp;open slope, tearing out small trees by their roots and hurling them into the rushing snow, which turned them into battering rams. A cabin that perched under the pines was wrenched from its foundation, its log walls torn asunder and broken into jackstraws.</p><p>The slide rushed onward, churning up chunks of ice the size of boxcars, gathering up abandoned hoses and machinery and the other detritus of mining that lay in its path. It hurtled on, thrashing its deadly cargo about, not slowing when it reached the bottom of the mountain, but instead rushing across the road, filling the gully with snow as heavy as wet cement and flattening the willows. The avalanche hurtled on until it started up Turnbull Mountain. Then, at last, its momentum came to an end and the slide was exhausted, the front stopping first, the back end slipping down the mountain and filling the gulch with snow higher than a two-story house.</p><p>Snow hovered in the air like a deadly mist. The debris caught up in the avalanche rolled a little and was still. A jack pine, graceful as a sled, glided to a stop in the snow covering the road. Clumps of snow fell from the trees still standing at the edge of the deadly white mass, making plopping sounds as they landed. Snowballs broke loose and rolled down the hill, leaving little trails in their wake.</p><p>For an instant, all was quiet, as silent as if the slide had occurred in a primeval forest. Then a high-pitched scream came from somewhere in the mass of snow, a child&#x2019;s scream. The slide thundered down Jubilee Mountain just after the grade school let out, and it grabbed up nine of thirty-two schoolchildren in its icy grip. Five of the victims were related, the children of the Patch sisters&#x2014;Dolly&#x2019;s three, who were Jack, Carrie, and Lucia, along with Lucy&#x2019;s two, Rosemary and Charlie. The slide was no respecter of class, because it took Schuyler Foote, son of the manager of the Fourth of July Mine, and little Jane Cobb, the Negro girl, whose father labored in the mill, and Sophie Schnable, the daughter of a prostitute. And then there was Emmett Carter, that near-orphan boy who lived with his grandfather. All of them were swept up and carried along in that immense swirl of white.</p><p>Four of the children survived.</p><p>WHITER THAN SNOW Copyright � 2010 by Sandra Dallas.</p></p><h2>Roaring Silence: Discovering the Mind of Dzogchen</h2><p>According to the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, <i>Dzogchen</i> is the direct experience of enlightenment. In <i>Roaring Silence, </i> Vajrayana teachers Ngakpa Ch�gyam and Khandro D�chen walk the reader through the meditation techniques that "enable us to side-step the bureaucracy of intellectual processes and experience ourselves directly"&#x2014;to discover this direct experience of enlightenment that is the mind of Dzogchen. <br><br>Surprisingly, the approach is very pragmatic. Offering an investigation of the necessary steps, the authors begin with how to prepare for the journey: the lama is essential; as are a sense of humor, inspiration, and determination. They continue by describing the path of Dzogchen from sitting meditation to the direct perception of reality. <br><br>The chapters include exercises for sharpening the presence of our awareness, for simple visualizations, and for investigating how to "remain uninvolved" with mental activity for a period&#x2014;with follow-up guidance on how to view our experiences. Both practical and inspirational, the authors' exquisitely precise guidance is all presented with the caveat, "be kind to yourself, don't push yourself beyond your limits."</p><p>Ngakpa Ch�gyam and Khandro D�chen, both Westerners, are teachers in the Nyingma School of Vajrayana Buddhism in the lineage of the Aro gTer. A married couple who teach together, they spend much of their time traveling and teaching in Europe and the United States. They live in Penarth, Wales.The authors, husband and wife, are both Westerners who teach meditation and other spiritual practices of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. Here they discuss the four traditional meditation practices (in Tibetan, Naljors) for achieving Dzogchen, i.e., utter totality. Readers conversant with Buddhism (especially Zen) will find much that is familiar, but this is no dry doctrinaire treatise. The authors have a pleasant conversational style and a lighthearted approach to religious practice. They strive to make Buddhist spiritual ideals intelligible to Westerners. Each chapter consists of a brief discussion, followed by some typical questions and answers. Specific meditation exercises are included. The text, however, frequently uses technical Tibetan religious terms without giving good definitions; a Tibetan glossary and cross-index to other Buddhist traditions would have been valuable. Thus, this volume will probably not appeal to casual readers. Nevertheless, it is recommended for academic libraries and public libraries with substantial religion collections. James F.

Tour.</p><p>Russian by birth, Jewish by descent, English by choice, Isaiah Berlin (1909-97) knit together three identities into a cosmopolitan sensibility that informed his contributions as one of the 20th century's most influential and important intellectuals. Based on his experiences as a child during the Russian Revolution and his friendships with such beleaguered writers as Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova, Berlin affirmed the superiority of individual freedom and judgment to Marxist totalitarianism. But he made fellow liberals uncomfortable with his unwelcome reminders that their ideals--liberty, equality, social justice--inevitably conflicted and required painful tradeoffs. London-based journalist Michael Ignatieff, who spent 10 years interviewing Berlin before his death, adeptly captures an appealing man: lighthearted, spontaneous, a brilliant conversationalist and lecturer (one of Oxford University's most popular professors), able to savor private happiness despite an essentially tragic view of political life. Ignatieff admires Berlin's views without accepting them uncritically; similarly, he acknowledges personal failings while appreciating the serenity Berlin achieved against considerable odds. This lucidly written, thoughtfully argued work is a model of the well-balanced biography, carefully evaluating the complex interplay of character and conviction in one remarkable individual. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Michael Ignatieff is a regular contributer to The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books.

Evoking feelings of awe and humility, they make us want to understand what inspired the people who had the audacity to build them. This engrossing book surveys an era that has fired the historical imagination for centuries. In it Robert A. Scott explores why medieval people built Gothic cathedrals, how they built them, what conception of the divine lay behind their creation, and how religious and secular leaders used cathedrals for social and political purposes. As a traveler&#x2019;s companion or a rich source of knowledge for the armchair enthusiast, <i>The Gothic Enterprise</i> helps us understand how ordinary people managed such tremendous feats of physical and creative energy at a time when technology was rudimentary, famine and disease were rampant, the climate was often harsh, and communal life was unstable and incessantly violent.<br><br>While most books about Gothic cathedrals focus on a particular building or on the cathedrals of a specific region, <i>The Gothic Enterprise</i> considers the <i>idea</i> of the cathedral as a humanly created space. Scott discusses why an impoverished people would commit so many social and personal resources to building something so physically stupendous and what this says about their ideas of the sacred, especially the vital role they ascribed to the divine as a protector against the dangers of everyday life.<br><br>Scott&#x2019;s narrative offers a wealth of fascinating details concerning daily life during medieval times. The author describes the difficulties master-builders faced in scheduling construction that wouldn&#x2019;t be completed during their own lifetimes, how they managed without adequate numeric systems or paper on which to make detailed drawings, and how climate, natural disasters, wars, variations in the hours of daylight throughout the year, and the celebration of holy days affected the pace and timing of work. Scott also explains such things as the role of relics, the quarrying and transporting of stone, and the incessant conflict cathedral-building projects caused within their communities. Finally, by drawing comparisons between Gothic cathedrals and other monumental building projects, such as Stonehenge, Scott expands our understanding of the human impulses that shape our landscape.</p><p>"This is easily the best book I have seen on why the great cathedrals were built. The breadth of Scott&#x2019;s scholarship is astonishing. As well as art history and architecture, he brings to bear his knowledge of subjects as wide apart as engineering, the sociology of religion, and the medieval economy. Only a handful of books truly throw light on the mystery of the cathedrals, and this is one of them." Ken Follett, author of <i>Pillars of the Earth</i><br><br>"Written in a lucid style and illustrated by dozens of sketches and photographs, this interdisciplinary survey is the best introduction to its subject now in print." Gene Brucker, author of <i>Florence: The Golden Age, 1138 1737</i><br><br>"Scott has given us a book of wonderful breadth and erudition with a refreshingly light touch. He describes vividly the social, political, and religious background to the great flowering of the Gothic cathedrals of Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and the strange mixture of motives that drove this astonishing building program. He is equally interested in the hard practical mechanics of hewing timber, erecting scaffolding, quarrying stone, transporting and hauling these materials as he is in the religious and liturgical symbolisms and conceptual schemes of the architects and their royal paymasters. Gothic cathedrals are astounding monuments to the aspirations of the human spirit reaching out to the divine, and this is a splendid introduction to the medieval worlds that produced them, written by an enthusiastic guide who really knows his subject and loves it." Hugh Dickinson, Dean Emeritus of Salisbury Cathedral<br><br>"Gothic architecture is notoriously difficult to represent verbally, but in Scott&#x2019;s book the joy so many people find in discovering these breathtakingly beautiful monuments is palpable." Stephen Murray, author of <i>Notre Dame, Cathedral of Amiens: The Power of Change in Gothic</i><br><br>"In this splendid book Scott writes precisely, clearly, and with a love for both words and his readers. Those who read these pages will come away enlightened, inspired, and with a more profound grasp of our civilization." Neil J.

But, looking beyond&nbsp;the widely accepted image of the king as egalitarian and virtuous, Handley portrays an anti-democratic monarch who, together with allies in big business and the corrupt Thai military, has protected a centuries-old, barely modified feudal dynasty.<br><br> When at nineteen Bhumibol assumed the throne, the Thai monarchy had been stripped of power and prestige. Over the ensuing decades, Bhumibol became the paramount political actor in the kingdom, silencing critics while&nbsp;winning the hearts and minds&nbsp;of his people. The book details this process and depicts Thailand&#x2019;s unique constitutional monarch&#x2014;his life, his thinking, and his ruling philosophy.</p><p>This is the first&nbsp;independent&nbsp;account of Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-serving monarch.

With the touch of an expert thriller writer, Tracy Kidder recounts the feverish efforts of a team of Data General researchers to create a new 32-bit superminicomputer. A compelling account of individual sacrifice and human ingenuity, The Soul of a New Machine endures as the classic chronicle of the computer age and the masterminds behind its technological advances.<br> "A superb book," said Robert Pirsig, author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. "All the incredible complexity and chaos and exploitation and loneliness and strange, half-mad beauty of this field are honestly and correctly drawn." The Washington Post Book World said, "Kidder has created compelling entertainment. He offers a fast, painless, enjoyable means to an initial understanding of computers, allowing us to understand the complexity of machines we could only marvel at before, and to appreciate the skills of the people who create them."<br> The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torch-bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.<br><br> Tracy Kidder has written a new Introduction to this Modern Library edition.</p><p>The computer revolution brought with it new methods of getting work done--just look at today's news for reports of hard-driven, highly-motivated young software and online commerce developers who sacrifice evenings and weekends to meet impossible deadlines. Tracy Kidder got a preview of this world in the late 1970s when he observed the engineers of Data General design and build a new 32-bit minicomputer in just one year. His thoughtful, prescient book, <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i>, tells stories of 35-year-old "veteran" engineers hiring recent college graduates and encouraging them to work harder and faster on complex and difficult projects, exploiting the youngsters' ignorance of normal scheduling processes while engendering a new kind of work ethic.<p> These days, we are used to the "total commitment" philosophy of managing technical creation, but Kidder was surprised and even a little alarmed at the obsessions and compulsions he found. From in-house political struggles to workers being permitted to tease management to marathon 24-hour work sessions, <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i> explores concepts that already seem familiar, even old-hat, less than 20 years later. Kidder plainly admires his subjects; while he admits to hopeless confusion about their work, he finds their dedication heroic. The reader wonders, though, what will become of it all, now and in the future. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br>"Kidder has endowed the tale with such pace, texture, and poetic implication that he has elevated it to a high level of narrative art. . . .

The fascination of his work has long since reached international proportions, and the concept 'Kafkaesque' has entered the English Language as an everyday part of speech.<br> This new edition of Kafka's famous story contains a critical introduction and notes which help to explain how the author achieves his particular effects. The editors are concerned less with what the story means then with how it blocks and baffles its reader, provoking them into an interpretation through its combination of clues and counter-clues, its questions and its uncertainties. Careful attention is therefore paid to the 'openness' of the text, to point of view, and to Kafka's use of language. The editors also consider the important biographical and cultural influences which shaped the writing of the story, and they outline some of the very different ways in which it has been interpreted --biographically, socially and psychologically.<br> A select vocabulary, aimed at the demands of the sixth-form pupil, is also included, and the text itself is taken from the original hardback edition.</p><p><p>Franz Kafka was born to Jewish parents in Bohemia in 1883. Kafka s father was a luxury goods retailer who worked long hours and as a result never became close with his son. Kafka s relationship with his father greatly influenced his later writing and directly informed his Brief an den Vater (Letter to His Father). Kafka had a thorough education and was fluent in both German and Czech. As a young man, he was hired to work at an insurance company where he was quickly promoted despite his desire to devote his time to writing rather than insurance. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote a great number of stories, letters, and essays, but burned the majority of his work before his death and requested that his friend Max Brod burn the rest. Brod, however, did not fulfill this request and published many of the works in the years following Kafka s death of tuberculosis in 1924. Thus, most of Kafka s works were published posthumously, and he did not live to see them recognized as some of the most important examples of literature of the twentieth century. Kafka s works are considered among the most significant pieces of existentialist writing, and he is remembered for his poignant depictions of internal conflicts with alienation and oppression.

Precarization and fractalization of labor have provoked a deep mutation in the psychosphere, and this can be seen in the rise of psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder, autism, panic, and attention deficit disorder. Sketching out an aesthetic genealogy of capitalist globalization, Berardi shows how we have arrived at a point of such complexity in the semiotic flows of capital that we can no longer process its excessive currents of information. A swarm effect now rules: it has become impossible to say &#x201c;no.&#x201d; Social behavior is trapped in inescapable patterns of interaction coded by techno-linguistic machines, smartphones, screens of every size, and all of these sensory and emotional devices end up destroying our organism's sensibility by submitting it to the stress of competition and acceleration.</p><p>Arguing for disentanglement rather than resistance, Berardi concludes by evoking the myth of La Malinche, the daughter of a noble Aztec family. It is a tale of a translator and traitor who betrayed her own people, yet what the myth portends is the rebirth of the world from the collapse of the old.</p></p><p>Franco Berardi, aka &#x201c;Bifo,&#x201d; founder of the famous &#x201c;Radio Alice&#x201d; in Bologna and an important figure of the Italian Autonomia Movement, is a writer, media theorist, and media activist.

Because interpretations differ, there is no single historical record, but various narrations of events each told from a different perspective. Therefore the study of history is intimately linked to the study of values, the values of the historical actors, the historians who have written about them, and of the students engaged in learning about them.</p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p> <i>The World&#x2019;s History</i> links <i>chronology</i>, <i>themes</i>, and <i>geography </i>in eight units, or Parts, of study. &nbsp;The Parts move progressively along a time line from the emergence of early humans to the present day. Each Part emphasizes a single theme&#x2014;for example, urbanization or religion or migration&#x2014;and students learn to use them all to analyze historical events and to develop a grasp of the chronology of human development. &nbsp;&nbsp;The final chapter employs all the themes developed in the first seven Parts as tools for understanding the history of our own times. Geographically, each Part covers the entire globe, although specific topics place greater emphasis on specific regions.</p></p><p>Howard Spodek received his B.A. degree from Columbia University (1963), majoring in history and specializing in Columbia&#x2019;s newly designed program in Asian Studies.&nbsp; He received his M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1972) from the University of Chicago, majoring in history and specializing in India.

We want to know, but what we hear is not always what we want to hear. Sometimes we take out our frustrations on the messenger. Today it is called media bashing, in ancient lands the prophet was stoned. John Guest points to the impact of Jeremiah&#39;s writings on the New Testament in Matthew, Acts, Paul&#39;s Letters, and Revelation. Regarding the Book of Lamentations, Guest observes that its first word &#34;speaks in the universal language of all humanity: a great sigh.&#34; It is &#34;a moan that collects the sufferings of all people bereaved of God and battered by their own sinfulness.&#34; The source of balm for this agony is still the God of Israel, the source of all restoration.</p><p></p><h2>The Long Affair: Thomas Jefferson and the French Revolution, 1785-1800</h2><p>As controversial and explosive as it is elegant and learned, <i>The Long Affair</i> is Conor Cruise O'Brien's examination of Thomas Jefferson, as man and icon, through the critical lens of the French Revolution. O'Brien offers a provocative analysis of the supreme symbol of American history and political culture and challenges the traditional perceptions of both Jeffersonian history and the Jeffersonian legacy.<br><br>"The book is an attack on America's long affair with Jeffersonian ideology of radical individualism: an ideology that, by confusing Jefferson with a secular prophet, will destroy the United States from within."&#x2014;David C. Ward, <i>Boston Book Review</i><br><br>"With his background as a politician and a diplomat, O'Brien brings a broad perspective to his effort to define Jefferson's beliefs through the prism of his attitudes toward France. . . . This is an important work that makes an essential contribution to the overall picture of Jefferson."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"O'Brien traces the roots of Jefferson's admiration for the revolution in France but notes that Jefferson's enthusiasm for France cooled in the 1790s, when French egalitarian ideals came to threaten the slave-based Southern economy that Jefferson supported."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"In O'Brien's opinion, it's time that Americans face the fact that Jefferson, long seen as a champion of the 'wronged masses,' was a racist who should not be placed on a pedestal in an increasingly multicultural United States."&#x2014;<i>Boston Phoenix</i><br><br>"O'Brien makes a well-argued revisionist contribution to the literature on Jefferson."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"O'Brien is right on target . . . determined not to let the evasions and cover-ups continue."&#x2014;Forrest McDonald, <i>National Review</i><br><br>"<i>The Long Affair</i> should be read by anyone interested in Jefferson&#x2014;or in a good fight."&#x2014;Richard Brookhiser, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br></p><p>Conor Cruise O&#39;Brien, the distinguished Irish diplomat, constitutional historian and writer, has produced a typically vigorous and sweeping polemic against the reputation of the author of the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson. O&#39;Brien contends that liberals are mistaken in claiming Jefferson as one of their own; indeed he regards the right-wing militias as the true heirs to Jefferson&#39;s spirit. Contrasting Jefferson&#39;s position with that of his longtime hero, the anti-revolutionary Edmund Burke, O&#39;Brien details the extreme edges of Jeffersonian political theory, in particular his commitment to the French Revolution even in the face of its excesses (&#34;rather than it should have failed, I would have seen half the earth desolated&#34;). For O&#39;Brien, the American revolution is still a glorious achievement, but Jefferson is demoted to a mere &#34;draughtsman&#34; of the Declaration.Certain to be as controversial and explosive as it is elegant and learned, The Long Affair is Conor Cruise O&#39;Brien&#39;s examination of Jefferson, as man and icon, through the critical lens of the French Revolution. Unable to speak the language, endowed with few close friends or colleagues, and curiously detached from Parisian intellectual life, Thomas Jefferson seemed an alienated and somewhat homesick Virginia farmer during most of his tenure as American Minister to France. But the advent of the French Revolution seized Jefferson with a new fervor, and in 1789 he returned to the United States an ardent admirer and ally of that cause. O&#39;Brien argues that Jefferson, though enthralled with the ideological mystique of the French Revolution, nevertheless retained a shrewd political pragmatism, skillfully exploiting the Revolution&#39;s popularity with the American public. Ultimately, O&#39;Brien suggests, Jefferson&#39;s egalitarian ideals came into conflict with his staunch political support for the slave-based Southern economy. Following the slave insurrection in Haiti inspired by the French Revolution, his revolutionary zeal was tempered and began to cool. Concluding with an evaluation of Jefferson&#39;s current role in the system of American political beliefs, O&#39;Brien seriously questions whether we can sustain Jefferson&#39;s lofty status in an increasingly multiracial America, and he suggests a disturbing link between Jefferson&#39;s vision and white supremacist, survivalist extremists. A provocative analysis of the supreme symbol of American history and political culture, The Long Affair will challenge our traditional perceptions of both Jeffersonian history and the Jeffersonian legacy.</p><h2>The War of the Austrian Succession</h2><p>Traces the causes and history of the war, looks at the aims of its major participants, and assesses its impact on the development of modern Europe</p><p>The War of the Austrian Succession proved an endless procession of unpleasantness among a handful of dynastic families that ruled Europe in the 18th century. It was such a hodgepodge of affairs that historiographers cannot agree whether it was one war or three. In Germany, the war is as likely to be called the First and Second Silesian wars. Nevertheless, Browning (history, Kenyon Coll.) tries to tie this series of squabbles into a coherent account. For the most part, he succeeds, except when he lapses into the archaic language of his subjects: "Maria Theresa embodies adamance amid asthenia." Browning presents little that is new in content or thesis. What makes this account worthwhile is that it is the first comprehensive, scholarly book of this war (or wars). Scholars of the era will find it interesting; the general public will find it longer than the war. For academic collections but a marginal purchase for public libraries.<br><i>- Randall L.

Durling's earlier translations of the <em>Inferno</em> and the <em>Purgatorio</em> garnered high praise, and with this superb version of the <em>Paradiso</em> readers can now traverse the entirety of Dante's epic poem of spiritual ascent with the guidance of one of the greatest living Italian-to-English translators. <br><br>Reunited with his beloved Beatrice in the <em>Purgatorio</em>, in the <em>Paradiso</em> the poet-narrator journeys with her through the heavenly spheres and comes to know "the state of blessed souls after death." As with the previous volumes, the original Italian and its English translation appear on facing pages. Readers will be drawn to Durling's precise and vivid prose, which captures Dante's extraordinary range of expression--from the high style of divine revelation to colloquial speech, lyrical interludes, and scornful diatribes against corrupt clergy. <br><br>This edition boasts several unique features. Durling's introduction explores the chief interpretive issues surrounding the <em>Paradiso</em>, including the nature of its allegories, the status in the poem of Dante's human body, and his relation to the mystical tradition. The notes at the end of each canto provide detailed commentary on historical, theological, and literary allusions, and unravel the obscurity and difficulties of Dante's ambitious style . An unusual feature is the inclusion of the text, translation, and commentary on one of Dante's chief models, the famous cosmological poem by Boethius that ends the third book of his <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>. A substantial section of Additional Notes discusses myths, symbols, and themes that figure in all three cantiche of Dante's masterpiece. Finally, the volume includes a set of indexes that is unique in American editions, including Proper Names Discussed in the Notes (with thorough subheadings concerning related themes), Passages Cited in the Notes, and Words Discussed in the Notes, as well as an Index of Proper Names in the text and translation. Like the previous volumes, this final volume includes a rich series of illustrations by Robert Turner.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert M. Durling</strong> is Professor Emeritus of English and Italian Literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. <strong>Ronald L. Martinez</strong> is Professor of Italian at Brown University. Their works together include Dante's <em>Inferno</em> and <em>Purgatorio</em> and <em>Time and the Crystal: Studies in Dante's "Rime</em> <em>petrose."</em><br><strong>Robert Turner</strong> has been a professional illustrator for thirty years.<br><br>"As Durling and Martinez complete their monumental three-volume presentation of Dante's masterpiece, we can sense their triumph and elation, despite their characteristic modesty. This, after all, is the volume with which they can demonstrate the fullness and consistency of Dante's great project, its final approach to what they describe in one footnote as 'a pitch of intensity unique in all literature.' The scholarship, as always, is graceful, comprehensive, and acute, and it surrounds a translation that is so carefully considered and fully realized as to be, at times, quite breathtaking."--David Young, translator of <em>The Poetry of Petrarch</em><p></p><br>"Durling and Martinez deliver <em>Paradiso</em> in elegant English prose faithful to Dante's Italian. The general introduction and succinct notes to each canto enable an informed reading of a frequently daunting text, while the longer 'Additional Notes,' bibliography, and indices will more than satisfy the most exigent critic. Marvelous, in the richest medieval sense of the term."--Michael Wyatt, author of <em>The Italian Encounter with Tudor England</em><p></p><br>"At the end of his poem Dante claims that his 'high imagining failed of power,' but Durling and Martinez have suffered no such fate in completing their translation of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Their <em>Paradiso</em> is a crowning achievement, a work of lucid prose and of impeccable accuracy. Readers will find themselves rewarded by the succinct, richly informative notes at the end of each canto and the extended essay-notes at the back of the volume. A splendid accomplishment."--Richard Lansing, editor of <em>The Dante Encyclopedia</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Student&#39;s Anatomy of Exercise Manual: 50 Essential Exercises Including Weights, Stretches, and Cardio</h2><p>Health and fitness trainers, students of sports science, and men and women intent on getting into better physical shape will recognize and value this manual as a key guidebook and information resource.

It is truly enchanting: a delightful romance combining realism and magic.</p><p>The hero, Lucius, eager to experience the sensations of a bird, resorts to witchcraft but by an unfortunate pharmaceutical error finds himself transformed into an ass. He knows he can revert to his own body by eating rose-petals, but these prove singularly elusive; and the bulk of the work describes his adventures as an animal. He also retails many stories that he overheard, the most charming being that of Cupid and Psyche (beginning, in true fairy-tale fashion, '<i>Erant in quadam civitate rex et regina</i>'). Some of the stories are as indecent as they are witty, and two in the ninth book were deemed by Boccaccio worthy of inclusion in the <i>Decameron.</i> At last the goddess Isis takes pity on Lucius. In a surprising denouement, he is restored to human shape and, now spiritually regenerated, is initiated into her mysteries. The author's baroque Latin style nicely matches his fantastic narrative and is guaranteed to hold a reader's attention from beginning to end.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Apuleius is in three volumes.</p></p><p><p>J. Arthur Hanson was at the time of his death in 1985 Giger Professor of Latin at Princeton University.

Just follow the sign to the beach, where a bunch of fun-loving crabs, lounging dogs, gleeful insects, and bewildered-looking snails obligingly offer their feet for counting in a number of silly, surprising combinations &#x2014; from one to one hundred!</p><p>April Pulley Sayre and Jeff Sayre are a husband-and-wife team who lead ecotours and travel extensively to study, photograph, and videotape animals in the rain forests of Panama, Madagascar, and Ecuador. They also speak at schools, botanical gardens, zoos, and nature festivals. Together they wrote a natural history book for adults. Jeff Sayre is an ecologist specializing in native plants and birds. April Pulley Sayre is an award-winning author of more than forty books for children. The Sayres love to brainstorm and laugh together - which is how the idea for ONE IS A SNAIL came about.<br>Randy Cecil graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design and is the illustrator of numerous books for children. He says of ONE IS A SNAIL, "It was great fun to figure out how these strange creatures would react in all these different combinations. Crabs seem to have the best time together!"PreSchool-Grade 2-The Sayres offer readers a fresh look at counting with a simple concept: the number of feet different animals have. The book begins with a snail's one foot, and then moves on to 2 for humans, 4 for dogs, 6 for insects, 8 for spiders, and 10 for crabs. Each odd number is represented by the even-numbered animal plus one snail. After 10, the numbers go by 10s to 100, with the number shown in two ways, for example: "70 is seven crabs- or ten insects and a crab. 80 is eight crabs- or ten spiders." All the animals are pictured on the beach, where most of them are involved in typical actions for their species; the fun-loving, playful crabs, however, bicycle, dance underwater limbo, play volleyball, and try new diversions on almost every page. Very simple text in large type is appropriate for group use as well as beginning readers. Uncluttered, black-outlined, oil-on-paper pictures clearly illustrate the concepts, and Cecil's googly-eyed snails, sports-minded crabs, and other animals add a touch of humor. Whether used with children just beginning to count or grade schoolers starting to multiply, this original and clever book will have wide appeal.<br><i>Louise L. Sherman, formerly at Anna C.

This book explores Gramsci's understanding of culture and the links between culture and power. Kate Crehan makes extensive use of Gramsci's own writings, including his preprison journalism and prison letters as well as the prison notebooks. <i>Gramsci, Culture and Anthropology </i>also provides an account of the intellectual and political contexts within which he was writing.

In Building Teachers Capacity for Success, authors Pete Hall (winner of the 2004 ASCD Outstanding Young Educator Award) and Alisa Simeral offer a straightforward plan to help site-based administrators and instructional coaches collaborate to bring out the best in every teacher, build a stronger and more cohesive staff, and achieve greater academic success. Their model of Strength-Based School Improvement is an alternative to a negative, deficit-approach focused on fixing what s wrong. Instead, they show school leaders how to achieve their goals by working together to maximize what s right.<br> Filled with clear, proven strategies and organized around two easy-to-use tools the innovative Continuum of Self-Reflection and a feedback-focused walk-through model this book offers a differentiated approach to coaching and supervision centered on identifying and nurturing teachers individual strengths and helping them reach new levels of professional success and satisfaction. Here, you ll find front-line advice from the authors, one a principal and the other an instructional coach, on just what to look for, do, and say in order to start seeing positive results right now.</p><p>This is an incredibly practical argument for just how school people need to work to improve classroom instruction. The authors have been there, done that when it comes to school improvement, and their Continuum of Self-Reflection is a wonderful scheme for keeping everyone focused on the things that really matter. ----Richard Allington<br><br>Monitoring classroom instruction is a critical tool for improving performance, and in this book, the authors describe the success they had with an approach to walk-throughs built on detailed individual feedback and coaching. It s a valuable contribution to the literature on walk-throughs and the impact they can have on student performance. ----Mike Schmoker</p><h2>A History of Modern Computing (History of Computing)</h2><p>This engaging history covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the advent of the World Wide Web. The author concentrates on four key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginnings of personal computing in the 1970s; and the spread of networking after 1985.<br> <br> Within this chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities. The author balances stories of individuals with those of institutions and emphasizes those factors that conspired to bring about the decisive shifts in the story.</p><p>This book delivers exactly what its title promises: a straightforward and comprehensive account of the electronic digital computer's first five decades. Starting with the historic ENIAC of 1945, Ceruzzi moves nimbly through one epochal generation of computing technology after another: the gargantuan, vacuum-tube-filled mainframes of the early '50s; the sleeker, transistorized minicomputers of the '60s; the personal computers conjured up by hobbyists in the '70s; and the computer networks that have come to span offices and the globe in the last 10 years.<p> Ceruzzi places all of these developments in the context of the social phenomena that shaped them: the imperatives of Cold War research, the evolving needs of information-swamped businesses, and the quirks and dreams of counter-cultural computer hackers. But unlike some popular books about computing history, this one refuses to acknowledge any particular individual, group, or institution as its protagonist. The tale it tells is complex: a weave of high-level projects, lowbrow tinkerings, and sweeping socioeconomic transformations, with a crash course in the basics of computer architecture tossed in for good measure. The mix doesn't make for great drama, but it does offer something perhaps more valuable--the sober, subtle feel of real history unfolding. <i>--Julian Dibbell</i></p>Paul E.

It has all the elements of a great adventure story: a plot full of twists and turns, an escalating sense of treachery and impending disaster, and a quintessential villain. Teenager Jim Hawkins finds a map titled &#x201c;Treasure Island&#x201d; in the belongings of a stricken lodger at the Admiral Benbow Inn in 1750s England. He soon finds himself aboard the schooner Hispaniola with a crew of disguised pirates headed to the Caribbean on a quest to find buried treasure. Long John Silver, the peg-legged cook, is the leader of this wretched crew. He is both engaging and ruthless, feared by even his barbarous accomplices, and a shape-shifter, pretending to be Jim&#x2019;s good friend and enemy, secretly plotting a mutiny. When mutiny begins, Jim must save the day. This beloved adventure story is pure fiction&#x2015;but fiction well grounded in historical and geographical reality. In The Annotated Treasure Island, editor and researcher Simon Barker-Benfield meticulously and lovingly annotates this voyage, offering crucial factual information, a sociopolitical context, and clear technical explanations that bring you closer to the action. Lavishly illustrated with pictures of nautical equipment, parts of ships, and period maps, The Annotated Treasure Island brings the seafaring vernacular to life. You&#x2019;ll learn about &#x201c;blocks,&#x201d; &#x201c;backstays,&#x201d; and &#x201c;shrouds.&#x201d; And you&#x2019;ll see Jim and the crew handle the Hispaniola, whether it&#x2019;s the &#x201c;simple&#x201d; chore of raising the anchor&#x2015;which in a similar, real vessel could require three hours&#x2019;-worth of hauling in a very slimy cable six inches at a time&#x2015;or the difficulty and meaning of &#x201c;warping&#x201d; and &#x201c;putting a man in the chains&#x201d; in order to take depth soundings. The story illustrations by Louis Rhead (1857-1926) deftly draw out the escalating dramatic tension. Would all the risk and hardship have been worth it? Just how much treasure was the crew after? What could one have bought with 700,000 pounds sterling in the 1700s? Even that question is answered in this newly annotated edition: it would have been enough to buy and outfit a fleet of eleven 104-gun battleships of the period.

At the center of the novel is a hilarious eleven year old--J R--who with boyish enthusiasm turns a few basic lessons in capitalist principles, coupled with a young boy's lack of conscience, into a massive and exploitative paper empire. The result is one of the funniest and most disturbing stories ever told about the corruption of the American dream.</p></p><p><b>William Gaddis</b> stands among the greatest American writers of the twentieth century. The winner of two National Book Awards (for <i>J R</i> [1976] and <i>A Frolic of His Own</i> [1995]), he wrote five novels during his lifetime, including <i>Carpenter's Gothic</i> (1985), <i>Agap Agape</i> (published posthumously in 2002), and his early masterpiece <i>The Recognitions</i> (1955).

It would be the tale of Gesine Cresspahl, a thirty-four-year-old single mother who is a German �migr� to Manhattan&#x2019;s Upper West Side, and of her ten-year-old daughter, Marie&#x2014;a story of work and school, of friends and lovers and the countless small encounters with neighbors and strangers that make up big-city life. An everyday tale, but also a tale of the events of the day, as gleaned by Gesine from <i>The New York Times</i>: Johnson could hardly foresee the convulsions of 1968, but some of the news&#x2014;the racial unrest roiling America, the escalating war in Vietnam&#x2014;was sure to be news for some time yet to come. Finally, it would be a tale told by Gesine to Marie about Gesine&#x2019;s childhood in a small north German town, of her independent and enterprising father, of her troubled mother, of Nazi Germany (Gesine was born the year Hitler came to power) and World War II and Soviet retribution and the grimly regulated realities of Communist East Germany. An ambitious historical novel as well as a wonderfully observed New York novel, <i>Anniversaries</i> would take in the unsettled world of the present along with the twentieth century&#x2019;s �disastrous past, while vividly depicting the struggle of a loving, though hardly uncomplicated mother and a bright, indomitably curious girl to understand and care for each other and to shape a human world. <br><br>Gesine and Marie are among the most memorable and engaging characters in literature, and <i>Anniversaries</i>, at once monumental and intimate, sweeping and full of incident, stylistically adventurous and endlessly absorbing, is quite simply one of the great books of our time.</p><p><b>Uwe Johnson</b> (1934&#x2013;1984) grew up in the small town of Anklam in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. At the end of World War II, his father, who had joined the Nazi Party in 1940, disappeared into a Soviet camp; he was declared dead in 1948. Johnson and his mother remained in Communist East Germany until his mother left for the West in 1956, after which Johnson was barred from regular employment. In 1959, shortly before the publication of his first novel, <i>Speculations About Jakob</i>, in West Germany, he emigrated to West Berlin by streetcar, leaving the East behind for good. Other novels, <i>The Third Book About Achim</i>, <i>An Absence</i>, and <i>Two Views</i>, followed in quick succession. A member of the legendary Gruppe 47, Johnson lived from 1966 until 1968 with his wife and daughter in New York, compiling a high-school anthology of postwar German literature. On Tuesday, April 18, 1967, at 5:30 p.m., as he later recounted the story, he saw Gesine Cresspahl, a character from his earlier works, walking on the south side of Forty-Second Street from Fifth to Sixth Avenue alongside Bryant Park; he asked what she was doing in New York and eventually convinced her to let him write his next novel about a year in her life. <i>Anniversaries</i> was published in four installments&#x2014;in 1970, 1971, 1973, and 1983&#x2014;and was quickly recognized in Germany as one of the great novels of the century. In 1974, Johnson left Germany for the isolation of Sheerness-on-Sea, England, where he struggled through health and personal problems to finish his magnum opus. He died at age forty-nine, shortly after it was published.<br><b>Damion Searls</b> grew up on Riverside Drive in New York City, three blocks away from Gesine Cresspahl&#x2019;s apartment. He is the author of three books and has translated more than thirty, including six for NYRB Classics.&#x201c;[An] oceanic, nearly 1,700-page masterpiece....[it] aims to be comprehensive on every topic it takes up&#x2014;among them, village life in postwar Germany, housing segregation on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, media coverage of Vietnam and the lead up to the Prague Spring...It requires a hard chair, a fresh pen and your full attention&#x2014;for attention is its great subject...Searls&#x2019;s superb translation inscribes Johnson&#x2019;s restlessness and probing into word choice and the structures of the sentences themselves, which quiver with the anxiety to get things right, to see the world as it is.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Parul Sehgal,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i> <i><br></i><br><br>"Juxtaposing the tumult of 60s America with everyday life in Nazi Germany,&nbsp;<i>Anniversaries</i>&nbsp;chronicles 20th-century turmoil through the eyes of Gesine Cresspahl, who leaves postwar M�nchengladbach to raise her young daughter, Marie, on New York&#x2019;s Upper West Side...Against the big-picture backdrop, we get a fine-grained treatment of motherhood and migration...It feels thrillingly spontaneous, almost out of control. You can certainly see why it wasn&#x2019;t all translated before now. But here it is: a novel of a year, perhaps the novel of the year." &#x2014;Anthony Cummins, <i>The Observer</i><br> &#x201c;Uwe Johnson&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Anniversaries</i>&nbsp;is a book to live in: two volumes and more than 1,700 pages of roomy universe, robustly imagined and richly populated. Its streets are long, and its landmarks are varied. Sometimes the weather&#x2019;s sultry, and sometimes the pipes clang in the cold. But Johnson&#x2019;s rhythm is always patient, always mesmerizingly meticulous...Johnson&#x2019;s observations are indeed possessed of a peculiar, sprawling omniscience. His opus belongs in the canon of encyclopedic, modernist German-language tomes like&nbsp;<i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Man Without Qualities,</i>&nbsp;and it allows itself divagations on everything from the prevalence of the color yellow in the American visual landscape to the subtleties of Hungarian politics...His writing is inhuman, godlike in its immensity.&#x201d; &#x2014;Becca Rothfeld,&nbsp;<i>Bookforum</i> <i><br></i> <br>"Johnson&#x2019;s book effectively gives the reader forty or fifty years of world history and a single year of Gesine&#x2019;s life, every day from August 21st, 1967 to August, the 20th, 1968. Its scope is startling, from the social organization of a small German town, to Gesine&#x2019;s work in a New York bank, to her father&#x2019;s work as a master carpenter, running a business in Richmond, in London.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tom Sutcliffe<i>, Saturday Review</i>, BBC Radio 4 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I am absolutely stunned and slightly mortified that I&#x2019;ve never heard of this book before...I think it&#x2019;s extraordinary, I think it is a great late-modern masterpiece...How do you map Germany in 1933 with Vietnam? But, he does it, he does it in the first paragraph. It should be clunky or absurd or just slightly embarrassing, but he does it brilliantly. It contains the whole world....I was completely gripped, and there are none of the usual narrative handholds, there&#x2019;s no romantic relationship, you&#x2019;re never quite certain why she&#x2019;s on her own, who the father of the child is&#x2014;all of those props are not available to us, and still it&#x2019;s absolutely extraordinary.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kathryn Hughes,&nbsp;<i>Saturday Review</i>, BBC Radio 4 <br>&#x201c;European modernists used the novel as a means of mapping metropolitan experience. From James Joyce&#x2019;s immortalizing of &#x2018;dear, dirty Dublin&#x2019; in <i>Ulysses</i>, to the grimy urban paean of Alfred D�blin&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>, to Robert Musil&#x2019;s elegy for imperial Vienna in&nbsp;<i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, the city was no longer merely decorative scrim but a collaborative possibility, the ideal vessel for consciousness. Uwe Johnson&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Anniversaries: From a Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl</i>, a sprawling novel about an East German �migr� and her 10-year-old daughter as they navigate life on New York&#x2019;s Upper West Side, is a natural heir to this tradition...&#x201d; &#x2014;Dustin Illingworth,&nbsp;<i>The Atlantic</i> <br><i><br></i> &#x201c;This book is truly a masterpiece. . . . It is a record, and an enduring one for our whole post-Hitler era. You have actually made this past tangible and&#x2014;perhaps a much harder task&#x2014;you have made it convincing. Now I know how it was and is over there&#x2014;know it down to the tips of my toes. . . . This seems to be the only appropriate way to speak and think: about great-grandmother and grandmother and mother and child, in the interplay of generations and across two continents.&#x201d; &#x2014;Hannah Arendt, February 7, 1972, Letter to Uwe Johnson <br><br>"Johnson's novel is now regarded as a hugely significant work of world literature, and it is indeed huge&#x2014;some 1,800 pages in the forthcoming two-volume publication from New York Review Books, the first complete publication in English....<i>Anniversaries: From a Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl</i> lives up to the hype. In my reading so far, it's carefully observed, utterly propulsive and resonant with meaning about a year I remember well, and I can't wait to finish it, though I concede that it will take some time. The bonus for me is local&#x2014;Gesine lived 14 blocks south of where I live now&#x2014;but Johnson's writing invites everyone into its riches." &#x2014;Barbara Hoffert, <i>Library Journal</i> <br>&#x201c;Uwe Johnson is the most incorruptible writer I&#x2019;ve ever read, always searching for what we so frivolously call the truth. In <i>Anniversaries</i> he approaches this fundamental thing, the truth, from different sides,&nbsp; across different continents, across time. Page after page, we are shown how we need to see clearly, without prejudice, to think properly. Page after page, thinking with Johnson offers us the greatest of pleasures.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jenny Erpenbeck <br><br>&#x201c;A gripping, complex, highly significant work in which the author displays not only his mastery as a storyteller but also his humor, irony, and descriptive power.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Johnson has Balzac&#x2019;s passion for the telling detail, the revealing exactitude, here a passion that is impelled by the imagination of love.
